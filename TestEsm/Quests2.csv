0x001FB85C,"RI04","Background Checks","The player is sent to speak and meet with Dalton Fiennes, Ryujin Industries Chief Security Officer. Dalton tells the player he and Masako are enacting Security Directive Theta. This means that every single Ryujin employee is going to be fully investigated by a third party company. The only ""exception"" to this is Ularu Chen who requires special attention due to her own skills as an ex-operative and current Chief Operations Officer. Because Ularu would be so good at covering any tracks, Dalton has contractd out a man named Nyx, the best hacker in the Settled Systems and the only one to ever breach Ryujin Security. Nyx is going to give the player a program to run on Ularu's computer, but the catch is that no one, not even Ryujin's own security can know this investigation is going on... so the player needs to infiltrate Ryujin Tower. Dalton informs the player their keycard will not be good during this time and any guards will consider them to be trespassing. He warns against killing any of the guards and arms the player with a Disurptor, a non-lethal weapon. He also says he'll ensure all non-essential personnel have left the building, so only the security guards will be there. The player infiltrates Ryujin through a vent system and does their best to avoid the guards, running Nyx's program on Ularu's computer and potentially that of another, Camden Cho. Once complete, the player returns to Nyx who analyzes the information and puts anything pertinent on a new slate for Dalton. The player returns to Dalton at a now normal Ryujin Tower where he quickly sees the evidence points to Imogene Salzo."
