Put again from your mind any notion of what you might have once learned about something people call God. Have no assumptions about belief or even divinity itself. If you are a believer by natural aptitude, try and place yourself in the mindset of the pure empiricist who adheres to the strictest scientism. If you are not a believer, take your skepticism and elevate it to its highest orders such that you will not even admit the smallest sense of the spiritual, the superstitious, or even such thing as a lucky roll of the dice.

All is physical, and all is determined. What we don't understand is simply for lack of exploration or appropriate mathematical tools. With sophisticated enough observatory instruments, we could explain the movements of every particle of being from the subatomic to the supercluster. There is no unseen hand which created anything, simply the forces of physics working mindlessly at each other.

And yet, a sunset may be still be lovely.

Certainly, we may be able to pinpoint the exact chemical breakdown of an atmosphere that refracts light from certain star types in a way that the human visual system finds pleasing, but this knowledge does not reduce the beauty... it rather enhances it. We may say that notions of beauty vary across societies and ages, but even such relativism cannot rob us of our particular experience in a given moment. We may not wish to see ourselves as anything more than happenstance firings of chemical signals driven by the grim lurchings of evolutionary processes, but to reduce ourselves thus still leaves the reality of a mind existing at a specific instant to experience a certain pattern of photons that it interprets in a manner that it finds beneficial in some way.

I would hope, even if you admit no possibility of the supernatural, that there is still space in your worldview for awe and for wonder. The universe is charged with grandeur. When we experience that grandeur, we come closer to the underlying reality of the universe.

The concept that such philosophers label as "God" is not necessarily that of any particular faith tradition. There is a noble attempt, with varied levels of success, to separate the doctrinal tenets of their lived religion from the philosophical projects they undertook. Their philosophical reasoning differs from that of a non-believer merely in that they are willing to allow for the possibility of existence of something labeled as "God." However, none of them set out to prove such an existence, since that question is itself the exemplar of non-falsifiability. The question of the existence of something that might be considered "God" is outside the realm of reason. However, once a person has come to accept either belief or non-belief as a truth via some act of faith, then reason can subsequently be employed to continue a discourse with that axiom.

So what do we mean, then, when we are to speak of something labeled "God"? You may note that I have not yet called this something directly and have never used the more traditional label without the deployment of quotation marks. This is to intentionally set distance between whatever associations a reader may have with the concept -- all the bundles of traditions and dogmas and doctrines and persecutions and violence and mania can all be set aside for the moment. I need you to forget everything you think you know about something that people might label as "God." Clear your mind to the tabula rasa, as best you are able. We proceed from here.

Now, from this blankness, esteemed philosophers have derived notions of the self or time and space as the singular foundation for understanding reality. I do not need to recapitulate their ideas here -- I trust a well-equipped data terminal may bestow upon you the gifts of the Meditator and the Imperator in this matter. Whatever sort of epistemological framework you choose to adopt, let us assume that you have agreed to some notion of the self and some notion of reality, even if you don't agree that the one can actually perceive the other. (And here the truest existential nihilists who wish to deny even reality itself may exit the car.)

Recall our prime maxim that "all people by nature desire to know." And so from this blankness we ask questions. Who are my parents? What is justice? Why do stars twinkle? Should I pursue a romantic relationship? All of these inquiries are ways of knowing and ways of thinking and ways of acting. And underlying all of it is the reality that we share. For ultimately, all questions eventually become some sort of "why." Why did my parents abandon me? Why was this injustice committed? Why was I rejected?

And whys have a way of coalescing towards a unified point. Your parents abandoned you because of their addictions, which came from their hardships, which came from their unjust society, which was formed out of scarcity, which is a consequence of mineral distribution on the planet, which derives from the relative weights of various elements in a molten proto-planet, which is correlated with their atomic mass, which relates to the interaction of subatomic particles, which...

And so proceed ad infinitum... but not quite. Because ultimately there is an epistemic barrier beyond which we can no longer ask "why?" Why do subatomic particles act the way they do? Because of quantum strings. Why do they act the way they do? Because of the laws of mathematics and physics. Why are those laws what they are? Why does causality exist? Why does anything exist at all?

That the chain of questions continues towards this asymptote cannot be denied. The staunchest unbeliever may be quite wary that the line of questioning is approaching realms that science can no longer address, but still they cannot deny the question itself. They may only assert that they do not care about the answer. These questions exist to their conclusion, though, whether or not we choose to concede defeat earlier in the sequence.

So we face the question of why there is even a reality to contemplate and find the tools of our minds lacking. There is, unquestionably, a mystery underlying all reality, and I do not speak of "mystery" in the sense of a puzzle we cannot solve or a murder that cannot be attributed. Rather I speak of Mystery, the proper noun, something so remote that it is not simply unknown but unknowable. Such mysteries can also appear in a more mundane context, such as the attempts to answer the question of "who are you?" without giving the more simple answers of your name, your occupation, your ethnicity, etc. The Mystery I speak of, that underlies all reality, is unknowable to the same extent that you and I are unknowable -- not because it is so distant (though it is), but because it is also so close. Transcendence and imminence come to a paradoxical unity, in a concept that our minds can barely comprehend the proper shape of its question.

So then, the mystery that underlies all reality is the very same thing that many in our past and present choose to label as "God." I myself will not use such a label out of both respect and caution about its traditional usage. But let us acknowledge that we are speaking of the same thing.

What function does this concept have in a hostile universe? This is why I asked you to discard all your previous notions tied to the Mystery, because there tends to be an assumption of benevolence or care associated therein. Already that is skipping many steps, as it ascribes a selfhood to the mystery, which is a prerequisite for intent, which is a prerequisite for will, which is needed before any ideas of agency can be questioned. A great deal of intellectual work remains to prove those concepts, and we will arrive to them in time. But for now, avoid thinking of the Mystery as anything other than the unknowable thing which underlies reality. The ground of being, the very cause of existence itself -- that is far more interesting and far more fruitful a starting place than any sky-king creators of ages past.

This form of Mystery becomes our new frontier of knowing. The acts and reflections that unite us to our ancestors continue in our new milieu, but we are forced by circumstance to reconsider all truths from the very first principles. For those who wish to embark on the crucial philosophical voyage of this chapter of humanity, I open my mind and provide these writings as guides and signposts. Seek me out, or seek my words; it makes no difference to those who wish to know the truth.

For indeed all people, by nature, desire to know.

Volume 1

All people by nature desire to know. This is the maxim of the Philosopher, the start of our most ancient discourse, and the continuing truth that unites humanity's current diaspora to its cradle around the yellow sun. The death of Earth may be cause for wistful reflection; its time as the center of humanity recedes ever further into the past, and living generations find it so removed from their existence as to amount to nothing more than historical trivia. Our technology and culture advance to forms that would be scarcely recognizable as human to even our recent forebears, and yet we still identify as part of the same lineage that first tamed fires and noticed that certain of the lesser heavenly lights seemed to move in patterns. This taming and noticing, the vital combination of act and reflection, is what separates us from all other beings we have yet encountered. This is the foregone essence of humankind: All people desire to know.

The subjects of that knowledge may vary across different cultures, epochs, and individual proclivities, but the need to know, to draw existing knowledge into new combinations and to expand what exists, is ever present. Even the simplest of us seeks to know their neighbor, or themselves, or their work. The more ambitious intellects may seek to know the truth of galactic superstructures or the social origins of modernity. That pursuit unites us as a single race more than any biological coincidence or historical lineage can.

Not all knowledge is of the intellect however, and different principled approaches may yield their subsequently different conclusions or qualities of understanding altogether. Here is where the first serious objections may be raised, particularly as the disciples of scientism begin the inhale of their great collective bellows so as to put forth pure empiricism as the only valid means of knowledge. I do not wish to dampen their enthusiasm nor do I deny the great benefits that have been found through that approach. Some of our earliest recorded disputes in the history of thought stem from whether reason or experience is the right path to knowledge. Our senses may be easily deceived, so we are forced to confront the possibility that they are always so. Our minds can be addled by decrepitude or confused by ideologies, making them no more trustworthy. To assign a place of privilege to either reason or experience is itself a curatorial act, which exists as part of a long philosophical tradition whether the chooser knows so or not.

All of this is to bring me around to my greater point, that of faith. I speak not here of supernatural belief itself, though I will shortly come to it. Rather, faith is the acceptance of a truth that has been given from another. Whether the other came to it by reason or experience, whether the other is one's superior or inferior, whether the truth is a factual or qualitative one does not matter. By incorporating a truth into one's knowledge without having arrived at it by individual means, a person is committing an act of faith.

Faith takes many forms that may be unexpected. The most passionate science chauvinist may believe in the existence of atoms, even though such things have not been, CAN NOT be observed directly. They believe in them out of a trust in sound evidence and mathematical proofs, but even then, have they themselves seen the evidence? Have they themselves performed the mathematics? At some point in their epistemological journey towards greater knowing, they have, with near certainty, accepted some truth on faith. That faith may be in their teachers, in their texts, in the process of peer review, in the very existence of causality, but faith it remains.

Which brings me, then, to the question of supernatural belief, particularly the ways such beliefs manifested in human religions over the course of our history. In these matters, both believers and unbelievers are quite willing to say that the method of knowing is faith. That reason may also be applied to these same matters is unsurprising, particularly in light of the original maxim which opened this text. Many a towering intellect has turned the full force of its powers to questions of faith, and these inquiries may prove to be enlightening exercises regardless of the reader's own commitments.

There is, though, a point of departure, for at the core, the very foundation of their thought, there is an assumption of the existence of something that these thinkers choose to label as "God."
===========ID 0x0000278F: Among the Grav Jumps, God Seeks You

Is God real? The more proper question would be, "Is reality divine?" Existence itself is a mystery which yearns to be uncovered.

What is goodness but a comparison to the Good? What is existence but a participation in Being? Any common attribute invites comparison to some more pure form of it, and as we work our way up the tree of attributes (from apples to red to color to waveforms to energy to spacetime to existence) we find fewer and fewer branches to explore. All of reality eventually converges into a single point. Some call it Omega. Others, Telos. Some call it God. But its true nature is best understood in another way.

For where the diversity of the universe inspires awe and wonder, it exists only in contrast to a simplicity so pure that it may only be understood as primordial and even divine. To say that it exists is effectively redundant as it is, in fact, Existence itself. Our being derives from Being. Our essence is what was imagined by its mind, but what we consider "imagining" and what we consider "mind" are in fact so far beyond our understanding that even these metaphors are like the tiny whitecaps on a massive surging sea.

Most urgently, this Being, which gave rise to reality itself, seeks to understand its consequents, by which I mean you and me. Our senses are limited and only able to perceive three dimensions as we are helplessly flung along the fourth in a single direction... but our finest minds tell us that the universe has at least twelve dimensions, and who knows what further knowledge may be revealed in time? From our meager capacity, the universe is not simply unexplored but fully unknowable in any comprehensive sense.

And so we rely on revelation. We submit ourselves to direct communion with the one source of truth, for Truth is another of its attributes, even as all the separate aspects resolve into simplicity. To know the truth, we must know the Truth.

And that Truth wishes to know us as well.

Our physical embodiments are limited to movement in three dimensions, just as fabric is bound to and defined by its warp and weft. But we have a power that raises us above the unminded matter that merely exists without will. We can bend the fabric of spacetime, rending warp from weft, peering through the veil that we may otherwise mistake for all that there is. When we do so, by jumping from point to point, we are not merely moving in space but becoming voyagers into a new level of understanding. Those moments between grav jumps are not simply nothingness, but glimpses into understanding of the Mystery that underlies all reality.

To know that Truth is to become closer to the divine ourselves. This is the purpose of our lives. The purpose of the Sanctum Universum is to guide you in these experiences so each opportunity to know is not squandered. Seek out Aquilus, let him open your heart to the understanding that it is no different from your mind, and join us as we seek further communion and increase our sharing in the nature of the divine.

The League of Independent Settlers is itself an independent organization, made up of signatory members and volunteer administrators and recruiters. We pride ourselves on our independence. We are and will remain free from corporate sponsorships, governmental regulations, and third-party entanglements of all kinds, so that our members particular needs are directly addressed, and their integrity and privacy ensured.

We also strive to keep operating costs to the barest of minimums, so that membership dues remain small and impactful. Among other cost saving initiatives, this means we do no large-scale media advertising, but instead rely on dedicated, hardworking individuals such as yourself, to help us find like-minded individuals to join us in our mission to bring a life of freedom and prosperity to all who wish it. 

From the grassroots to the top of the administrative branches, LIST is a people-first organization, and it is a core LIST value to always empower individuals to be their best-selves. To that end, we have put together this small booklet to offer suggestions and ideas to help release your own potential. Consider this not so much a recruiting manual, but rather a collection of inspiring ideas to draw from when crafting your own unique recruiting style.

[The next 20 pages include a list of benefits for joining LIST, ways to identify motivated recruits, sample sales pitches aimed at various needs and personality types, and a detailed FAQ, all of which are peppered with platitudes and assertions of principle. It concludes with the following reminder.]

Remember, we have tried to make this as easy as possible. Our "Top of the LIST" pamphlet is scientifically proven to work 90% of the time in securing long term commitment to the organization and eventual resettlement for the recruit. So, as long as you have properly identified a motivated individual, if you are having trouble convincing them, try handing them a pamphlet. You can obtain additional copies of "Top of the LIST" from the LIST representative that hired you as a recruiter.*

Best of luck out there! We could not do this without you. You are an integral part of what makes LIST special. So, launch out there and be your best self! And remember the LIST motto:

[Included is a rather incomprehensible list of varieties of species.]

When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature.

THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS
I.
THE EVE OF THE WAR.

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.

The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.

Captain TEACH
alias BLACK-BEARD.

Edward Teach was a Bristol Man born, but had sailed some Time out of Jamaica in Privateers, in the late French War; yet tho' he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon Boldness and personal Courage, he was never raised to any Command, till he went a-pyrating, which I think was at the latter End of the Year 1716, when Captain Benjamin Hornigold put him into a Sloop that he had made Prize of, and with whom he continued in Consortship till a little while before Hornigold surrendered.

In the Spring of the Year 1717, Teach and Hornigold sailed from Providence, for the Main of America, and took in their Way a Billop from the Havana, with 120 Barrels of Flower, as also a Sloop from Bermuda, Thurbar Master, from whom they took only some Gallons of Wine, and then let him go; and a Ship from Madera to South-Carolina, out of which they got Plunder to a considerable Value.

After cleaning on the Coast of Virginia, they returned to the West-Indies, and in the Latitude of 24, made Prize of a large French Guiney Man, bound to Martinico, which by Hornigold's Consent, Teach went aboard of as Captain, and took a Cruize in her; Hornigold returned with his Sloop to Providence, where, at the Arrival of Captain Rogers, the Governor, he surrendered to Mercy, pursuant to the King's Proclamation.
===========ID 0x000027A0: And yet, despite its reputation as the Settled Systems' premiere "pleasure city," Neon is also home to a plethora of criminals, ruffians, and assorted dregs. Some of these malcontents merely walk the streets alone, preying on lost tourists who have strayed too far from the beaten path. But the worst offenders are the organized groups, those who have banded together for a common criminal cause. The worst offender is, of course, the Seokguh Syndicate - a crime syndicate bold enough to publicly flaunt their name, and rumored to be affiliated with, or even directly controlled by, Neon mayor Benjamin Bayu. And then, of course, there are the smaller (yet no less dangerous) street gangs - the Ebbside Strikers and the Disciples. As with most gangs, their members pride themselves on being "family," but the only blood they're interested in is what they can spill in the streets.

OMEGA:
THE LAST DAYS OF THE WORLD.

CHAPTER I.
The magnificent marble bridge which unites the Rue de Rennes with the Rue de Louvre, and which, lined with the statues of celebrated scientists and philosophers, emphasizes the monumental avenue leading to the new portico of the Institute, was absolutely black with people. A heaving crowd surged, rather than walked, along the quays, flowing out from every street and pressing forward toward the portico, long before invaded by a tumultuous throng. Never, in that barbarous age preceding the constitution of the United States of Europe, when might was greater than right, when military despotism ruled the world and foolish humanity quivered in the relentless grasp of war - never before in the stormy period of a great revolution, or in those feverish days which accompanied a declaration of war, had the approaches of the house of the people's representatives, or the Place de la Concorde presented such a spectacle. It was no longer the case of a band of fanatics rallied about a flag, marching to some conquest of the sword, and followed by a throng of the curious and the idle, eager to see what would happen; but of the entire population, anxious, agitated, terrified, composed of every class of society without distinction, hanging upon the decision of an oracle, waiting feverishly the result of the calculations which a celebrated astronomer was to announce that very Monday, at three o'clock, in the session of the Academy of Sciences. Amid the flux of politics and society the Institute survived, maintaining still in Europe its supremacy in science, literature and art. The center of civilization, however, had moved westward, and the focus of progress shone on the shores of Lake Michigan, in North America.
===========ID 0x000027C4: THE CRYSTAL EGG

There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of "C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed. The contents of its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished.

[1899 saw the publication of this collection of H.G. Wells' works, which is comprised of three short stories and two novellas - The Crystal Egg, The Star, The Man Who Could Work Miracles, A Story of the Stone Age, and A Story of the Days to Come.]

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL

(Kept in shorthand.)

3 May. Bistritz.  - Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.

[So begins Bram Stoker's 1897 masterpiece, Dracula - a book that would define horror for generations to come.] 
===========ID 0x000027C8: [While W.E.B. Dubois is famous as a writer, civil rights activist, and sociologist (among other things), it is not widely known that he also penned a science fiction short story. The following is an excerpt from The Comet, written in 1920.] 

Low on the horizon lay a long, white star-mystic, wonderful! And from it fled upward to the pole, like some wan bridal veil, a pale, wide sheet of flame that lighted all the world and dimmed the stars. In fascinated silence the man gazed at the heavens and dropped his rockets to the floor. Memories of memories stirred to life in the dead recesses of his mind. The shackles seemed to rattle and fall from his soul. Up from the crass and crushing and cringing of his caste leaped the lone majesty of kings long dead. He arose within the shadows, tall, straight, and stern, with power in his eyes and ghostly scepters hovering to his grasp.
===========ID 0x000027CA: When I heard the learn'd astronomer, 

When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, 

When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, 

When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, 

How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, 

Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself, 

In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, 

Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars. 

[Walt Whitman's When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer, while only one stanza, neatly encapsulates the author's disdain for the scientific overanalysis of nature's beauty.] 
===========ID 0x000027CC: [The following is a passage from T.S. Eliot's "Rhapsody on a Windy Night, one of the poet's earlier, almost cynical, works."] 

The lamp hummed: 

"Regard the moon, 

La lune ne garde aucune rancune, 

She winks a feeble eye, 

She smiles into corners. 

She smoothes the hair of the grass. 

The moon has lost her memory. 

A washed-out smallpox cracks her face, 

Her hand twists a paper rose, 

That smells of dust and old Cologne, 

She is alone 

With all the old nocturnal smells 

That cross and cross across her brain." 
===========ID 0x000027CE: [Written in the summer of 1838, Longfellow's The Light of Stars is a stirring tribute to the cosmos, before humanity had ever explored it. The following is a single, beautiful, stanza.] 


Within my breast there is no light 

But the cold light of stars; 

I give the first watch of the night  

To the red planet Mars. 


The start of the unconquered will, 

He rises in my breast, 

Serene, and resolute, and still, 

And calm, and self-possessed. 
===========ID 0x000027D1: Ah, love, let us be true 

To one another! For this world, which seems 

To lie before us like a land of dreams, 

So various, so beautiful, so new, 

Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, 

Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; 

And we are here as on a darkling plain 

Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight 

Where ignorant armies clash by night. 

[So reads the final stanza of Matthew Arnold's stirring poem, Dover Beach.] 
===========ID 0x000027D3: Damocles Grey looked up into the eyes of the Reptilon High King, and grinned. "Well, Boots, I think it's time I made my exit," he quipped. Then, raising his wrist-mounted com device to his mouth, he said the words he had uttered so many times before: "Let's do it, baby." 

A second later, Damocles Grey's sleek chromium deathship crashed through the palace's stained-glass dome, raining lasers on any lizardman its targeting computers could get a lock on. 

"It's the Sword! Everybody ru-" But the High King never got to finish his command, because a gaping hole now stood in the space where his mouth used to be, blasted straight through by one of the ship's laser beam guns.  

The Sword then came to a hover two inches off the ground, right next to Damocles Grey. "That's for Earth, you ugly iguanas," he said, as he swung up into the cockpit and closed the canopy. Seconds later, there was no indication Damocles Grey had ever been on the planet Reptilar III... except for the pile of dead Reptilons left in his wake. 

[The science fiction novel Sword of Damocles was written by former Constellation chair Visola Chen after her retirement, writing under the pen name Victoria Star. Although over a million copies were printed, very few actually sold, and eventually Chen decided to distribute the book for free. Now Sword of Damocles is something of a pop culture staple, and copies can be found throughout the Settled Systems.]

Day 21, 14:54
Mr. Hughes reported an emergency with the particle accelerator engineering team. Code Blue, full trauma kit on standby. Was it methane poisoning? A bite from some terrifying, venomous lifeform? No. Evidently, Mr. McCarrick dropped a drill on his foot while assembling the containment housing. Minor bruising, not even a sprain. Clearly, we're dealing with dangerous, unknown phenomena here.

Day 64, 01:15
There's been an explosion on the research level. Full security lockdown, alarms blaring. Hughes is trying to regain control. I am, of course, standing by.

Day 64, 05:42
Director Patel ordered us to stand down at 05:00.

We have one presumed fatality: Mr. Aguerro, our chief engineer, was conducting a late-night test when the explosion occurred. There was a brief release of hydrogen gas, quickly contained. No other injuries reported.

The research level is still locked down; there's apparently no way to get down there short of an excavation team. That kills the research schedule for the rest of our tour. I suggested sending a distress signal to see if we could be relieved early. The Director shot it down.

Four more months. Just four more months.

Day 64, 02:18
There's a hydrogen leak. The explosion must have ruptured the tanks on the research level. It's in the ventilation system. We can't contain it from up here. We can't evacuate because of the lockdown.

Hughes is still trying to reset the system, or at least cut the air interchange, but it's going to take a few hours. If the levels rise much further, the entire facility could combust.

There is something to be said for boring days.

[This is the final entry.]
===========ID 0x0000330F: This is Vanguard Moara. Sorry if I had to reclaim some UC property, but this whole staryard is overrun. I've patched up my ship, and I'm heading to Neptune.

The machines tell me I am someone I am not.

I will <b>not</b> play by their rules.
===========ID 0x00003313: Unanswered questions:
1) Who created the Facility?
2) Is the Mission the real reason it was created?

4) Are any people watching us?

===========ID 0x00003315: I managed to break in to the top floor. It is a spaceship, as we all assumed. The records call it the Galathea.

Most of the ship has been stripped down, but amazingly the comm system was operational. There was a message from another ship called the Beagle. When I played the transmission it was just raw noise.

I will try to go back tonight.
===========ID 0x00003316: This confinement is driving me crazy. Day after day underground.
I think Genghis is right, escape is the only option.

To think Babbage and I would open this untold world of knowledge and power!

I realize I never will be a masterful programmer, I have no books or texts to advance myself, but the intricacy of the security here is daunting.

The Facility is on full lockdown and the only solution is the Security Override Code. 

But where is it? This part of the Facility was closed to us until Genghis set off his explosions. And even here, there is nothing of the sort. If only I had more time to think, but the monsters lurk in every hall now.

Perhaps the damage to the Facility means this is my final life? A pity. So much more to discover and learn.
===========ID 0x0000331A: I woke up for the first time right here. And now I bleed.

When first I heard the Mission, I felt a thrill. We were chosen. We would rule again.

But after spending countless days? nights? Who is to say in these windowless halls.

We do nothing. The Facility feeds us, the Facility provides. And we just... argue.

But now we do more. We turned to murder.

I pray you find this, brother of my blood.

Do not trust <u>Bill Hickok</u>. He is not who he seems.
===========ID 0x0000331D: Genghis somehow got a hold of explosives. Last night we woke to a thunderous din.

The Facility has been repeating incessantly: Containment Breached. It is maddening.

An expedition was sent to the outside this morning, they report predators... deadly ones, all about.

Victor Aiza: Judith...

Judith Tatienne: But you've had me building these prototype colliders for months! And now you want me to pump Helium-3 into it based on this equation you've written on a god-damned napkin!

Victor Aiza: I just need you to trust me.

Judith Tatienne: I HAVE been trusting you! We keep slamming our heads against a brick wall, getting nothing, and you keep coming up with something new to try, like you know what's going to happen! Where are you getting your information, Victor?

Victor Aiza: I'm sorry, Judith. I... look, not here, okay? Somewhere off-base. I'll tell you everything. But... I'm not lying okay? We're going to discover something important here. I promise.
===========ID 0x0000334B: Station log. Judith Tatienne. I have never been so nervous since I defended my dissertation.

Four hours talking to Victor and his team about theoretical metals, atomic bonding, even a half hour divergence into magnetism that I'm pretty sure was just to throw me off the trail of what we were talking about. 

Then I got to see the lab. I... I don't know how much I should say, but the periodic table just got thrown out the window.

===========ID 0x0000334D: Station log. Judith Tatienne. I've been trying to cozy up to Doctor Aiza... Victor... to see what is going on. 

His team has completely commandeered one of the labs with those two military handlers checking who comes in and out.

I joked that maybe he found a little gray man and was doing an autopsy, and he grew very pale.

I remember this smell back at the station. 

It was from some lab, where they were ripping apart oxygen with bolts of electricity, and it messed with the ozone.

That's what this smell reminds me of.

===========ID 0x00003396: Ugh, John is such a kiss-ass. I don't understand why Kaylin likes him so much. Getting pretty sick of the fact that he's been getting extra time off too. I'd bring it up to Kaylin, but I'm already on thin ice as it is. Hate this place... I can't wait to finish out my time and move back to NA.

===========ID 0x0000339A: I think it's sweet that John and his crew gave up their leave to build that ramp for Kaylin. Poor guy... I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't walk. Just sit and get fat I guess. Maybe things wouldn't be much different, actually...


===========ID 0x0000339B: I knew it would be rough out here, but I didn't expect this. These storms seem to be getting more frequent, and stronger. The gear isn't holding up like it should be. We can only do so much to keep it held together. It's not safe here right now...

===========ID 0x000033A0: This is shit. Not what I signed up for. Not what any of us signed up for. We already lost Lewis. When people start dying, it's time to back out. I'm telling Owens I'm done.

===========ID 0x0000353D: Our relationship has always been a challenging one. You're my blood, but not my child. I don't mean that in a cruel or dismissive way. I mean only that, had I raised you, and not Astrid and William, you wouldn't be the woman you are today. Perhaps you might've been something greater. President or Fleet Admiral. Or perhaps you'd be like all your siblings.

Instead, you became who you are now. A truly fascinating result. In you, I see myself through another lens. What could've been if I hadn't had my own strange upbringing.

And while I understand that all children wish to strike out of from their parents (a sapling can't grow in the shade of the tree, after all) you were - literally - born to command. Instead, you've chosen to play with animals. It was bad enough when UC society turned on us for doing our duty. But to watch you undersell your own greatness is nothing short of a travesty.

So, as these may be my final moments, I implore you - don't squander your gifts. If I took nothing else from our talks over the years, it was this: you can and should lead. Show the Settled Systems we're more than they think us to be. Show them what it means to be a Sanon.

===========ID 0x00003541: If you're reading this, loyal UC cog, it means the Cabinet has finally found the guts to do away with me. Good for them. While I've been in no hurry to return to the dust from whence I came, I consider myself almost lucky. After all, it is the first indication the group has any spine at all.

I sincerely hope this is a sign of things to come. 

Otherwise, you and the whole of the UC are doomed. 

Simply look at the world around you. House Va'ruun shutting down their embassy and retreating for "unknown reasons" back to their nest? The Freestar Collective in their most powerful position since their founding?

Conflict is brewing, little cog. And do you trust this Cabinet to get you through it? They couldn't even defend their own spaceport from Heatleeches. What will they do when House Va'ruun returns in full force? Talk? Hard to do when you've intentionally shuttered your own embassy. Do you believe when they come back it will be in any form other than as bloody crusaders?

And look at the Freestar Collective. The UC's capitulation during the war, their inability to make the hard - but necessary - choices, has put the Collective in a position of supremacy for the first time in human history. They're like a tumor, that rather than being excised, has been being permitted to grow larger every day. Now perhaps the UC will use their newly discovered spine and actually do something to stymie this more powerful Collective before it's too late to stop them.

But I doubt it.

No, dear cog, this Cabinet will no doubt revert to their old ways. Scared. Acquiescent. Unwilling to make hard choices. 

But by then, I'll be gone. And you will have to deal with the consequences.

So then which of us is the lucky one?
===========ID 0x00003544: Our O2 scrubbers are shot and we don't have much time left. The captain says he has a plan and sent us down here but I think they locked the door. I have no idea what they're planning but I hope they're ok up there.

We can't breathe and everything is starting to fade. Please hurry.
===========ID 0x00003546: I can't believe I'm going through with this but I've got no choice. The fleet took away my family and everything I care about. There's no way I'm going back, and neither is anyone else aboard this ship. I damaged the O2 scrubbers and told the crew they'd be safer in the hold, but that's a lie.

The universe is better without us.

===========ID 0x0000354A: I don't know why they came after us, but they did. They had no idea what they were looking for, they just knew that there was something here. So I did what you told me and made sure they never found it. 

Unfortunately, they disabled our grav drive and pretty much everything else. So I guess we'll be floating out here forever, but hey, at least I kept it safe.

But I do see the anger in your heart. And Cora, if you are anything close to my daughter, I know that'll be something you won't find easy to let go of.

Constellation is gone. Sounds like it was thriving from wherever you came from, but here it fell apart just as we were getting close. Take over the work. Please. You'll find all the data we gathered on this slate. And the Eye is ready for someone to search for the Temples again.

Give yourself a better purpose in life than revenge. I'm not worth it.

===========ID 0x00003578: Linda,

I've been doing some calculating. By my estimation, there is a one in ten to the seventy eight billionth chance of me drifting into range of another ship before my rations run out. However, the odds of me being found orbiting some star somewhere within your lifetime are marginally better; one in ten to the thirty six thousandth. So on the off chance someone finds my body, and you're still alive, I figured I'd leave you this note.

I should have listened to you. You always were the brains of our duo. I was just the mechanic that put it together. We were a good pair, though. That's how we got so much further than we ever could have imagined; together, lifting each other up, celebrating each others' victories, never needing to stop because we never wanted any more than to be facing this world together.

And I can't help thinking that if I hadn't gone this alone, I wouldn't have ended up here, without you.

I learned enough about statistics from you to know that I'll never get to see you again. But at least I'll get to spend the last of my days loving you, and knowing you loved me too.

Hey foreman, Dundas and Curtis were able to scrounge up some guns for the ship. For a Miner, Curtis has a nose for weapons. Nenadovic has some suggestions on where to hit remote ships, so we're finally underway. Two or three hits should give us a good haul and then we'll head back. 

- Captain Becker


<b>Going Dark</b>

Hey again, we're in position. Everyone is excited, Rizky maybe too much. But it feels really good to be on this side, hope you'll join us next time. Hate to say it, but mining is for chumps. No offense. 

Don't know how long we'll have to wait, but we can keep ourselves busy. I'm shutting some things down so folks don't give away our position, so you won't hear from us until we're ready to return.

- Captain Becker


<b>Everyone's Pirate Names</b>

Good job on the new names everyone! Please stop using the real ones, they aren't scary enough.

Rosemarie is Rummy C
Aurel is The Asp
Lesley is Vulture, but she isn't "the" Vulture
Miladin is Knifeshadow
Rizky and Yuliana are Risky Rover and Firekat

And we're no longer flying the Dancer In the Darkess either!

- Bloody Jurgen, Captain of the Black Dreadnought

<b>Crew Name Suggestions</b>
Date: 4-13-2330

We need to put the fear of God into anyone we attack. As long as folks know we're serious, they should roll right over. No one needs to be shot or stranded. We leave with the goods, and they'll carry on just fine.

Look, we've been raided enough times, this is tough. Knifeshadow had an arm broken, and the Asp's brother is still in a coma from the raid after that, but they're still here because they know we need to be tougher. Give me your best names!

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom, Captain of the Black Dreadnought 


<b>Crew Name</b>

Still accepting suggestions for our crew name. 

The Asp, you're the only one who hasn't given me anything, I need a better commitment.  Risky Rover, I know you have a shtick but the group doesn't share it. Love the enthusiasm but shake up your list and choose a few favorites. The accent is also a bit much, we need to be intimidating.

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom, Captain of the Black Dreadnought


<b>Small Targets</b>

I'm bored too, but we're new at this and need to wait for a small target. Knifeshadow had a few ideas, one will pan out.

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom of the Fists of Titanium, Captain of the Black Dreadnought and scourge of the Big Dark


<b>Aurel Constantin is a hypocrite and a killer</b>

Miladin went in shooting. He wasn't supposed to. But we're pirates, Rizky  shouldn't have been so shocked afterward. They should have been ready for this. Aurel said he didn't want to kill people either. Didn't stop him when the argument got heated and the Captain pulled a gun. Becker went down and everyone started shooting.

Aurel didn't realize I wasn't dead when he gathered up all of the slates and wiped them. Missed this one in the captain's boot just as he missed my breathing.  

He tried to remove all of the evidence and flee in the ship we hit, but I'm letting you know so he can't come home. Don't let him pretend he isn't a killer too.

===========ID 0x0000358B: Great Children of Clemens, the time has come!
The Clemens Comet makes its pass through this star system one fortnight hence.
This is your chance to Awaken and become one with the great celestial body. No other opportunity shall be afforded to you in this or any other lifetime!
Come with me and join your soul with the great comet and fly eternally across the stars!

The Star Child
===========ID 0x0000358C: Let's see. Let's see them forget me now.
I am the master of my destiny. I am the master of everybody's destiny.
They follow me into the dark. And the universe will remember what I did.
I make myself eternal.
===========ID 0x0000358E: I cannot believe the moment of awakening is upon us. To merge with the Clemens Comet and be eternal. It is really happening.

I tried to convince Susan to come with me one last time, or at least let me bring Malcolm. She refused to listen to my reasoning. She bawled, said I was leaving our son without a father. But she just doesn't understand. It pains me to leave my family to suffer. But if she cannot see, what more can I do? I have tried to pass on The Star Child's message. If she does not want to receive it, I can do no more.

I do not fear what comes next. I know that the great journey is just beginning. 
===========ID 0x00003591: I've done the calculations, and it is clear that The Star Child is correct. The Clemens Comet has an average tail length of fifty-six million miles. This tail consists largely of plasma and ionized gas. Readings from The Scientific Spiritual indicate that our souls are made of the same ionized gas. From some independent experiments I've conducted on interactions of gases, I have concluded that if we part our souls from our bodies while in the tail of the comet, as The Star Child suggests, they should seamlessly join with the comets tail.

Some have said that I was foolish to do my own calculations. That it would be preposterous to doubt The Star Child.

I say it is foolish not to do your own research. 
===========ID 0x00003593: This has been the greatest time in my life. Chasing the tail of the Clemens Comet, together with the only rational people in the universe. We are united in our love and passion for the stars, our dreams of the future, our knowledge that we deserve more than what we have. Never before have I met so many like minded people. For the first time, I am not alone.

I almost wish we did not have to join with the Clemens. It is nice to dream of simply traveling the universe forever, a new colony we have built for ourselves.

But the Awakening waits for no one. I know it is what is best for all of us.

===========ID 0x00003594: I couldn't do it. I didn't drink. And now everyone is gone. And the comet has passed.
I could see their spirits leave their bodies. I could feel them latch onto the comet as I was left behind.
I'm such a fool. A fool and a coward. How could I have doubted the comet's wisdom?
===========ID 0x0000359A: Things have been tough since Mom left, and Dad died. I'm very alone here, but I'm hanging in there. Dad was never quite the same after she left. And Mom, well... I'm glad she's gone. I never seemed good enough for her. And her new boyfriend was kind of a jerk.

I'm finishing up school, and then, hopefully I can get out of here too. But, it's hard because even though my classes cost next to nothing, I still have lots of expenses and I barely have enough to eat. I only earn scraps from Jae and Anja. It's not like they have tons of credits either. And because I have to take time away from my studies, my grades suffer. It sucks. Why is everything so HARD?

How do other people do this? No one around here has really gone to college except for Dr. Lakota, and maybe that new lady, Joyce. Dr. Lakota doesn't really have time for me, and the few times I went for advice, she was just like, "Stick with it, kid, you'll get there if you put in the work."

I don't know what to do. I thought writing it down would help, but now I just have a place I can remember how bad I feel right now, so that's cool.

I didn't think Aurel would volunteer, but he knows how desperate we are and is always ready to help.

You know we're struggling here, and I know you won't let us down.

Hey again, we're in position. Everyone is excited, Rizky maybe too much. But it feels really good to be on this side, hope you'll join us next time. Hate to say it, but mining is for chumps. No offense. 

Don't know how long we'll have to wait, but we can keep ourselves busy. I'm shutting some things down so folks don't give away our position, so you won't hear from us until we're ready to return.

===========ID 0x000035DF: I can't find the key to the supply chest. The worst part is I just used it the other day so I know it's around here somewhere. 

I'm sure if I clean the place it'll turn up, but I need those supplies now.

I really hope I didn't leave it in my pockets again. That would be embarrassing.
===========ID 0x000035E1: I can't find the key to that damn supply chest. AGAIN. This is getting ridiculous. I'm ridiculous. How hard is it to hold on to one damn key? But somehow I keep losing it.

At this rate it'd be faster if I learned to pick locks.
===========ID 0x000035E2: Supplies are running low. People are going to fight over whatever's left. 

We need to keep things locked down. I might hide the key, just in case.

Hopefully they all realize this is for the best.
===========ID 0x000035E4: Where is that damn key
Where can you effin' be
Why must you torture me
Stupid stupid stupid key
===========ID 0x000035E7: Got a tip on a buried treasure. Just need to make sure no one else knows about it. I'll just tell my boss I'm taking a little trip. He has no idea it's one-way.

It has the supplies I need
Why does life hate me
===========ID 0x000035EB: Not sure if I can cut through the container. These crates were designed to resist most laser cutters, but it's worth a shot. I've got a better chance with it than with the digipick, anyway.

Probably doesn't make a difference. At this point I'm dead regardless of whether I get it open.

But when I see this crate in hell I want it to know I won.

Okay, now that I typed it out I realize he said "attuned" with yourself. That makes way more sense.

I think I get it now, being out here, in the depths of space. I can see myself spending more time out here. Just me and the stars.


===========ID 0x0000361A: The Captain had everyone fooled. Almost everyone.

I can't believe I followed their ridiculous plan right into this death trap.

I should've spoken up when they suggested it, and now I'm paying the price for their foolishness.

But who's the bigger fool, right? It's not the one who came up with the plan, and it's not the one who follows it blindly. It's the one who follows it against their better judgment.



===========ID 0x0000361D: The Captain's dead. Everyone, dead.

I think I might be next, if I'm lucky.

Baby, I miss you. I'll see you on the other side.
===========ID 0x0000361E: Rescue is en route. All personnel are expected to promptly report to the docking bay for evacuation procedures when notified. 

Failure to comply in a timely manner will result in disciplinary action.

I don't know if you'll ever get to read this. I feel like I should write it anyway, in case something happens. If this somehow ever finds its way to you, I hope it brings you the closure that you need. 

The ship has been getting bombarded by solar flares. The systems are out, and the engines are dead. If by some miracle we're able to get things running again, another flare hits us and we're back to square one. We've been sending SOS signals out, but so far it's just been radio silence. I don't think we'll be able to get out of this one. 

I don't really know what else to say, but I just want you to know that I love you. Give the kids a hug and kiss for me.

Anne


===========ID 0x00003624: There's an old Swedish proverb which says luck never gives; it only lends.

So when I drew straws with Gutierrez over who was going to do fix the exterior, I wouldn't say I was given a break. I was just lent a little more time.

Besides, Gutierrez was the better choice. He's always been the brave one. He tried to fight the Fleet when they boarded, and lost a tooth in the scuffle. Me, I hid in a corner. I've got a mouth full of teeth and all they do is chatter.

When the vote came over whether to consume the body, I cast my vote in favor. We needed the energy, and here was our lucky break. But while I felt good at first, I couldn't keep any of the meat down.  

Gutierrez told me I was lucky, and at the time, I agreed. But I was only borrowing it you see, it was never mine to keep.


===========ID 0x00003627: The results for the magma/obsidian composition are in. I've never seen anything like this before. There's a one-in-a-million chance to have this perfect of a mix, and we got it. 

I'll continue perfecting the recipe and thinking of potential uses. This could change everything!

===========ID 0x0000362A: The program finally finished merging the AI to the mainframe. All systems up here are now fully automated. Now that that's finished, I can turn my focus to other matters...
===========ID 0x0000362D: Something's gone wrong. I don't understand, my design was sound, the code compiled correctly, everything should've worked without fail. The AI has taken over the entirety of the upper level. It won't let me communicate with the settlement or use the elevator. I'm a prisoner to this AI... I have to find a way to deactivate it. 

===========ID 0x00003631: The upper level is now fully autonomous, and your presence is no longer necessary here. You are being reassigned back to the factory, effective immediately.
===========ID 0x00003636: We're just now finishing a series of tests for the new alloy recipe. Its resistance coefficient increased by 56%. This is crazy... to our knowledge, there are no other known materials in the universe that are as resistant as this.

I don't know if it's Callum or you who got the idea to add obsidian to the mix, but we're going to be rich thanks to you. We should start working on a campaign to reach manufacturers.

===========ID 0x00003637: I shouldn't have touched that cocoon. I shouldn't have breathed in those spores.

I'm so tired. And this pain in me chest won't go away.

I want to stand, but I can't feel me toes. Can't even wiggle 'em.

The doctor gives me a look over, and says I'm fine. Whatever I got, I'm not contagious.

But I see it in her face. I can tell. She's tired too.



===========ID 0x0000363A: We've been stuck in this room for days. There's so little oxygen in our tanks you can probably count the molecules on one hand.

But I've told the crew to ration slowly, and keep their heartbeats still. We'll try to stay alive as long as we can, in case another ship finds us.

It's important we stay calm, because the more we panic, the more oxygen we consume. I've asked each crew member to say some words to help distract us from the situation, but I think they misunderstood the assignment.

First Mate Szczerbiak used the moment to give me a eulogy, which started a trend where we each spoke on another's behalf. I reminded them, we still might live. All this talk of death and dying was not my intention. 

But at the same time, talking about each other reminds us what we're living for. So, I let it go.

===========ID 0x0000363C: Pete Nishikawa was a good man. Not great, but good. Just barely too. You're like one unpaid docking ticket from being average.

No, I'm kidding Pete. I just want to make sure not to inflate your ego. You're looking a little light there, and the last thing we need is you hovering over us.

Anyway, if Aleksy is the straight man of the group, then Ensign Nishikawa was the joker. I kind of feel like wherever he went, he made a conscious effort to be the most unserious person in the room.

But he also had a big heart.

Pete was the kind of person who always insisted on paying for drinks, even though he didn't have the creds. He would light up the room with his smile, and would always listen when you needed someone to talk to. Pete, I gotta say, you being on this ship made the void of space feel a little less lonely. Thank you.

Your pal,
Iris 
===========ID 0x0000363D: Ever since that cocoon started releasing spores, I've been feeling sluggish.

When I wake up, my body feels like it weighs a million kilos.

When I sit down, my mind feels like it's in a fog.

I took some pills and a day off to recuperate, but it's only gotten worse.

I can't even hold this slate proper without my hands shaking. I told Browder about my troubles, and he just looked at me with dead eyes and a thousand yard stare. 

What's happening to us?
===========ID 0x0000363F: Iris! I still remember the day you tracked me down at The Broken Spear.

You came at me with a resume and list of qualifications longer than a sporeback's neck. At first I only said "yes" so you'd stop badgering me.

But having you on this crew has been a delight. As a Captain I like to go with the flow. Iris, you measure the flow, graph it, and then come up with a plan to smoothly ride it before we've even set course.

So having your counsel and energy on this ship has been invaluable. And also, he won't admit it, but I think Pete likes you. Sorry Pete. If you're not going to say it, I will.

Your Captain,

===========ID 0x0000369A: It's been a difficult road and I never imagined having to do this... But we found the perfect place for our beloved Allie's ashes. Her favorite lullaby was about stars and I sang it every night. So, what better place to finally lay her to rest than among the stars?

Allie was our world and ever since that day we just haven't been the same. My wife took it especially hard. We've barely spoken, she barely eats, but goddamn it I never expected this.

I did everything I could but it was too late. Last night she did the unthinkable. I have no idea what's left for me...

Allie
===========ID 0x000036A9: They grav jumped right on top of us and had our shields down in an instant. Minutes later, we were being boarded. 

The leader of the group said we were hostages, and that if we cooperated we'd be spared. I've talked with the others, and we've all agreed the best thing to do is stay put and pay whatever ransom they ask for.

But that means nothing if they don't believe us. Now one of the Spacers keeps asking about a passenger in a nightgown. The others insist there's no one like that on board. I've kept quiet for the most part, but the truth is, I've seen her too.
===========ID 0x000036B3: One of the crew said he heard noises in the engine room. I'm guessing it was that young couple fooling around again, but he was adamant the voice was singing.

But I'm inclined to ignore the report, seeing as this particular crew member has issues. He just spent a week in the clinic for dropping a wrench on his foot, which only broke his toe because he was working barefoot. 

Point is, he's got maybe half a dozen brain cells and they all take turns. Wouldn't surprise me if this was just ringing in his ears.
===========ID 0x000036B5: The others think I'm spacesick, or just in need of some company. But I know what I saw. It was a woman, barefoot, in a nightgown.

I made such a stink of it, the boss checked the manifest, but there weren't anyone matching her description, so now I look like a bloody fool.

But she could've been a stowaway. Probably hid herself on board, and is hiding from us now. That'd explain why the crew don't even know her.
===========ID 0x000036BA: Sometimes when everyone's asleep, I like to walk the ship and clear my head. Around this time you can hear just about everything, from the low groan of the ship's engines to the squeak of my boot heel touching the floor. But lately I've been hearing a strange humming, high and soft, like a child's voice.

I tried to find the source, but every time I step toward it, it's behind me. Or I'll hear it below deck, climb down the ladder and it's over my head.

Maybe it's just IN my head. Space has a way of doing that to all of us.
===========ID 0x000036BC: In the void of space, it's not uncommon for tall tales to undergo a series of growth spurts. With so little to do and so much time to fill, exaggeration proves far too tempting mistress. But the legend of The Pale Lady is not one that has grown vertical with time, but rather, it has stretched sideways - passed around like a game of telephone until all that remains is the eponymous lady in white.

I've heard variations where the lady was a machine, a ghost, and an asteroid field. They say old Earth tigers could mimic the sounds of other animals to lure prey, and it almost seems that the Pale Lady can swap origins just as seamlessly to create whatever collective panic she wishes to inspire.

The only common denominator is the lack of survivors. Unfortunately, this also makes connecting these incidents to their origin nearly impossible. In my research, the oldest reference I could find was the following words, written in an explorer's log, which mentions a woman with a pallid face:

In hushed tones, we echo the silenced.

Through ardent screams, we give breath to the drowned.

Invoke her name, for her pallor is light. 

And truth will find refuge in death's embrace.


===========ID 0x000036BE: Ever since Peter died, I've been having a hard time sleeping. The whole story about the Pale Lady was cute at first, but now I get startled whenever the ship creaks. Too many old bones. In it, and me.

The Doc says it was pneumonia. Really? What kind of pneumonia turns a man's face white as chalk? When we get back, I want to bring Peter's body to the clinic, and get a proper autopsy.

There's four of us. We've been hiding in the trainyard for... days now. We need an evac. NOW. We're low on food and melting ice for water, but we can hear them, constantly. Crawling all around the hab. It's only a matter of time before they find a way in there. 

I snuck out here to drop this off and nearly became Morph food in the process.

If you're here to evacuate the city, DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT US. We're in  the Londinion trainyard control room, up above the platform.

She's out of her mind. There's no other explanation for it.

Because if General whoever-the-hell-she-is wants 130k additional ration packs by the end of the month, she either needs to start defending her damn supply ships better or find me a new source of materials! 

My people can synthesize food all day long, but only if we've got the damn ingredients!

And if she doesn't like it, then she can go kick sand. Or ice. Whatever.

My negotiations with UC brass didn't yield the result I was hoping for. They've asked us to "get creative." Whatever the hell that means. 

<b>LOG FILE: 431.30</b>
Retooling's done. First batch from these big Londinion lummoxes - these Aceles things - went through the pipe and came out clean and vacuum sealed. 

But - and this is the truly shocking part - the test batches we ran and sent to the front for "quality assurance?" The troops actually liked them. They liked RATIONS. 

We're going to run a couple more test batches, make sure it wasn't a case of mass psychosis, but if they're as good as they appear, we're going to become a full-Aceles facility.

<b>LOG FILE: 512.06</b>
We've now got multiple plants on multiple worlds churning out these new rations. They're even talking about breeding Aceles on other planets. 

A military runs on its stomach and from here on out, the UC runs on Aceles meat.

<b>LOG FILE: 648.11</b>
Another. Damn. Increase. 

The brass can't keep upping their order requests like this! Yes, General, we understand there's a damn war, but what the hell are we supposed to do?! Play boudoir music for them? Aceles just don't breed fast enough. We're exploring swapping in new biomaterial, but the yield and quality aren't nearly the same. But I'm honestly not seeing any other options.

<b>LOG FILE: 684.23</b>
Sent another pair of scout ships out. Nothing. Shipments have dried up and no one's seen a native Aceles in two weeks. The farms on the other worlds have been all picked clean too.

<b>LOG FILE: 715.17</b>
We've retooled again. Some other critter's our food stock now. Some crustacean-looking thing with a lot of meat. Congratulations, UC. You've successfully eaten the Aceles out of existence.
===========ID 0x00003716: When you get back from your patrol, can you please find the key to the supply chest? 

You keep on losing it and then I get locked out. This wouldn't happen if you left it in the same place every time.

I don't need to remind you those are the last of our current supplies, and not having access to them can be the difference between life and death.
===========ID 0x00003718: Searched all over the Settled Systems... made it here with half a liter of water left. Spent the rest of it trying to find the markers, and triangulate the location.

Now I've got it. Dug the box up. After years dreaming about it, I see it with my own eyes. The box is real.  

And the damn thing's locked.
===========ID 0x0000371B: To whom it may concern:

My daughter Sylvie is part of the UC Remote World Learning Program. In this month's study kit, she was assigned a book titled "The Hills Cry Jemison." As I do all books assigned to her, I took to reading it first to judge suitability for my daughter.

How do you get off giving her this garbage to read? Her assigned learning counselor tells us it's really about building friendships, learning to tolerate others' differences, and overcoming adversity. That's all fine and good. Those are important lessons, but I see it for what it is nothing but propaganda, promoting your planet. My daughter is a proud New Homesteader, and I see to it she remains that way. I don't want her getting silly ideas in her head about picking up from her home and family, and moving to your consumer wasteland of a world. Sylvie will NOT be reading this book.

I want my daughter to learn, but if you keep sending her material that pushes her away from me, I'll have no choice but to home school her, which places a huge burden on my family, due to our farming responsibilities. Please reconsider the reading material you send our way.

===========ID 0x0000372B: Ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon in 1969, humanity has been obsessed with the idea of permanently breaking free from the confines of Earth's gravity. Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.

But in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA's mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.

And then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity's greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity's ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.

Of course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth's planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050.

===========ID 0x00003743: [An excerpt from Rupert Brackenridge's last autobiography, published on Earth before the departure of the ECS Constant.]

...But crisis looms in our future, whether we want to believe or not. While  Earth may not be fragile - it's faced a number of mass extinctions, meteor strikes, ice ages, wars, and other global catastrophes - the human race only has one home, and if that home becomes inhospitable, no number of underground bunkers will be enough to survive the tide.

Precisely, this is why I started the Earth Colony Ship Initiative. It's why I reached out to the best and brightest minds of the 22nd century for their funding, and their expertise. If humanity is to not only survive, but thrive, we must shoot for the stars. It is my hope, that others reading these words will join me in this endeavor and follow my lead. I'm tired of waiting for politicians of the world to agree on a course of action to preserve humanity for all of time. This is why it's up to private enterprises, such as my own Bracken Global, to develop our own ventures.

Upon its completion, The ECS Constant, will be the first ship of its kind. A colony ship, built to transport a selection of humanity beyond our solar system, deep into territory unknown, to our new Garden of Eden. My scientists assure me our new home is fundamentally perfect in every way. And, I aim to keep it that way. It will be a world built on renewable energy, a reliable, equitable foundation from which our new society will grow. And from there, new colony ships will be built and sent to new planets, to colonize them under the same ideals and values. A brilliant new future for humanity.

And though it may take hundreds or thousands of years, I have little doubt that it will lead humanity to brave new frontiers and set a shining example for any other life we may find along the way.

...Larysa just smiled. The machine continued to blink its lights and emit faint whines as its servos whirled, unsure of how to proceed. But machine-communication was Larysa's specialty. She flicked the buttons on her universal comm unit, its LEDs blinked rapidly in response to her movements.

"It's okay," she signaled through the device. "I won't hurt you. But, if we've any hope of getting out of this cave, we'll need to work together."

Larysa hadn't expected her day to go like this, trapped in a disused mining tunnel under the surface of Mars with a frightened and potentially hostile maintenance robot, but her espionage training had prepared her for similar situations. 

The machine clicked and beeped in response, "I trust you." It wasn't a direct translation. As precise as machine binary language was, there was still a lot of room for misinterpretation when translated to her native tongue. It was close enough. The robot seemed to relax. Its glowing aperture expanded to let more light in as it gazed at her, taking in any information it could gleam from her. And then, it extended one of its many clamps in her direction. She took hold and with a firm, yet gentle tug, pulled the small robot out from under the rubble.

"There we go. That's better, isn't it?" She asked, clicking out her message on her comm unit. "Now, if you can lead me out of this tunnel and back to my drop ship, I can call for backup that could help your fellow machines fight back against your oppressors."

June 16, 2141:
I've been hanging out with Ezra a lot lately. There aren't many other people my age on board, and Pier is already interested in Janika, so I figured maybe it'd be a good idea to get to know him? Turns out we have some things in common. We both like retro movies and games. He introduced me to some music I hadn't heard before, like Sasha and the Lowdown Thieves. It got me thinking though: we'll never hear anything new from bands we like. Ever. Maybe we should start a band? We'd have to learn how to play music, of course. I'll have to see what Ezra thinks.

Mom says everyone gets assigned a job here on the Constant.

It was only a month ago when I asked him if he had any regrets in life, and he told me that no, spending it with me was all he dreamed it could be and more, wherever we were. While I still wish we had not been trapped on the Constant, I can think of no better person to have spent my life with. I'm thankful for his love and companionship all these years, and will miss him dearly.
===========ID 0x00003750: [An excerpt from the non-fiction book, Launch Point Mars, about Mars' early role in space flight]

...Along with the abundance of raw resources, the lower gravity, and the existence of the Cydonia colony base made Mars an ideal location for launching new ships deeper into the Sol system. For many years, the famous Mars Launch Pad was used for this purpose, and many scientific discoveries took place as a result. Humanity built outposts on numerous moons under the light of Sol.

Of course, when new grav drive technology came online, thanks to the likes of companies like Nova Galactic and Deimos Staryards, technological advances made constructing and launching ships from orbit a much better prospect. The Mars Launch Pad transitioned to a means of transporting resources and workers to the staryard in orbit. As ship designs began integrating take-off and landing systems, the Mars Launch Pad became less and less relevant. It wasn't long before the project was quietly abandoned. Yet, it stands as a monument to the times, even today...

We haven't been here on this planet for long, and already I'm worried I can't deal with this. Most people, Brackenridge included, seem entirely fine with the deal that we've made with these people. And while the legends were true, this place IS paradise, our situation is less than ideal. 

I was given my choice of jobs here, which is a step up from the ECS Constant, but all of these jobs suck. I can be a "Sanitation Technician," which is a fancy way of saying I get to clean toilets all day. Or, I could be an "Event Coordinator," which means I get to help OTHER  people have fun but never have any myself. OR, I could work as a "Ship Services Assistant Mechanic," where I'm allowed to do light maintenance and wash other people's ships who are allowed to come and go from this planet as they please.

1. Always address guests with respect and warm smiles. Without our guests, we have no resort, and you don't have a job.

2. Cleanliness is key. The smallest speck of sand where it doesn't belong can ruin someone's day. If you see anything amiss, either clean it yourself, or report it to the nearest Sanitation Technician as soon as possible. This goes double for your personal hygiene.

3. Comfort, comfort, comfort. Always offer guests whatever accommodations they may need to be at their most comfortable. Don't shy away from upselling.

4. You are a representative of this resort, whether you're on the clock or not. You are free to relax in your off-hours, but you must always remain professional. Imagine the ideal guest, the kind that creates as few problems for you and your job as possible, and BE that guest.

This is our second time here, and I must say that while the beaches are nice, I wish they were a little more spread out. We stayed in one of the deluxe beachfront cabanas this visit, which was very posh and comfortable. Though, my husband ordered the "Six Prawn Delight." We felt it was way overpriced, but we're on vacation, and decided to splurge. Unfortunately, he got violently ill afterwards and had to be lifted to the nearest hospital facility off-world. Anyway, I'm kind of enjoying the resort now a little better without him here. It seems much quieter and calmer without his complaining. Also, I was told there would be wind surfing? Why is there no wind surfing?

If anyone tells you, like the title of this book, that life back in the early colonies could be described as "simpler times," they're full of it. The title, thusly, is a repudiation of the idea. You'll see the claims in various forms of media, brochures, and other corporatized devices that life was somehow simpler than we have it today. The portrayals in such series as the old family friendly show, "Hab on the Ice," for instance, paint an idealized perspective of New Homestead that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Life was never simple here. The people you're about to hear from, some dating back to the mid 2100's, provide a unique insider view into what it was really like on Titan. You'll read about their struggles in the new frontier era, as well as more current accounts of what it's like to preserve that veneer while dealing with a galaxy that has moved on.

This impressed Florence. Was Tal'at really willing to put everything on the line just to protect her compatriots? She knew the war was ridiculous, but to see him face his commander now and absolutely refuse a direct order, knowing that it could amount to treason. This was the same Tal'at, who no more than a week ago had carried out an order to ambush and lock up her entire squad. She knew there was a gentleness to the man, but until now she had not been able to know for sure just how reasonable he could be.

He knew the gravity of the situation, but she had taught him so much about this unjust war in their few short days together, that in this moment, he decided even if it cost him gravely, he would do the right thing. As he noticed the other officers begin to shuffle uncomfortably, noting a break in their resolve, a smirk crossed his face. The cracks began to show.

All your forward progress with IntelliWheat seems to have stalled. If you can finish the plans for how we can scale up production there are immense business opportunities.

---Ideas and Musings---
The universe is a song, a melody. We are its notes, dancing on interstellar sheet music. I float toward the Middle C, the center of everything, and find the drumbeat of my own heart. I listen to the rhythm of the stars, and find plumes of stardust in my own breath. 

And I know then that what was lost will be found again. Ancient vibrations, hymns of the dead. They sing a dirge for those who have not yet lived.

===========ID 0x000037B9: Every day there's a new leak. Or maybe it's just the hunger, making us smell things that aren't there. Paska, at this rate we're going to die either way.

Hunger for me is a bigger concern than the gas right now. So when we lost Gutierrez, there was a pause in the room before Qvist said what we were all thinking. 

When he made the proposal, Kimes nearly took his head off, which we all understood would happen given it was her man's body. Captain Manyonga abstained, leaving it up to a vote, and so we cast it. 

I'm not a religious woman, but I feel llike I'm literally taking a bite of the apple here. But Guiterrez would understand, even if his sweetheart didn't. He was out there because he wanted us to fix this ship, and now he's going to help us finish the job.
===========ID 0x000037BC: I have received the slate containing your proof that Society funds are being diverted to my own personal account and the copies of receipts for the home I've purchased under a false name on Paradiso. Though I was initially dismayed that you'd turn these over to the authorities, I appreciate your discretion by choosing to handle this personally.

To that end, I'm certain we can work out a financial solution to the problem. The Society will be hosting a "charity" event aboard the Siren of the Stars, which means another round of donations will be hitting the accounts that I can access. After the Siren arrives at its destination, we should meet and discuss our new partnership in person.

===========ID 0x000037BE: Got a fresh report on Captain Ahab - the combat bot with all the security protocols that's been hunting that one nasty looking Siren for a couple weeks (month? years?) now.

Torque was pulling copper lines out a couple frames out past Warren's Gulch, and he says he heard this beacon coming out of the Syracuse. Says it "sounded like the death knell from a sputtering engine of destruction" which translated from Torque-speak means our transplanted bot probably got himself in trouble and is now stuck inside the Syracuse.

So for us that means... well, nothing really. If he's got enough power to run that beacon, it means he's possibly enough power to fight us if we try and scrap him. But once he's out of juice, that machine'll make for a rich payday.

Saburo's a good and honorable man. Pride won't allow him to accept my money, but what he doesn't understand is, the game is rigged. Even in good times, variable interest rates are designed to landslide you.

All I want is to give him a fair shake. I may not believe in every idea he has, but I believe in him. He just needs a financial partner who can offer some direction. Someone who has his best interests at heart.

I won't lie, given my position, it may be a conflict. But my feelings for him aside, I really do want to help.
===========ID 0x000037CC: <B>Note 1 </B>
I hate feeling useless, so I'm writing this instead of hugging my knees in the corner. There was an explosion. We weren't attacked, something on the ship just went pop. We have no idea what, but whatever happened, it killed the power. Even the backups aren't kicking in. Not even sure if life support is working, but at least we're not venting atmosphere. We think.

There are two others with me. They own the ship, I just hitched a ride to visit the homestead since they were headed that way. I forget their names, but they're scrambling right now and doing a lot of yelling, so I'm not going to ask.
If we don't make it, I suppose you'll know what happened to us. Maybe better than we will. Tell our families we love them.

- Penjani Alvez


<B>Note 2 </b>
There's still not much we know, but we at least confirmed the distress signal is transmitting. I'd hazard a guess life support is busted after all, because we've all developed a bit of a cough. 

For the record, the others' names are Tariq and Saliha Shadid. Apparently they're cousins, though Tariq's  at least 20 years older.

Turns out Saliha is a huge nerd. Thank god. She was fascinated by one of the Apollo missions that happened in the 1900s, where their oxygen tanks blew and they had to make an air filter out of random junk to survive. She says what's she's whipping up is a different solution for a different problem, but it was that story that made her learn to do...whatever this is.

I helped scrounge around for the stuff she needed, so at least I contributed.

<b>Note 3 </b>
If the cabin hadn't gotten so cold, we might not have noticed the heat from a fire that started behind some paneling. As if we weren't low enough on oxygen already.

We don't know what caused it, but Tariq had to squeeze himself into a tiny service compartment to try to put it out. We heard another bang while he was in there and then screaming. We managed to drag him out, but his entire upper body was badly burned.

While I applied first aid, Saliha made the insane decision to crawl back in and finish putting out the fire. By some miracle, she came out not too worse for wear.

Things are calm for now. Tariq is alive but unconscious - definitely a mercy given his condition. I'm not going to describe how it smells in here.
Saliha and I agreed we should both try to sleep so we use as little oxygen as possible while we wait for rescue.

This is the last I'll write until then. If I wake back up because I can't breathe, I don't think I'll be able to use a data slate.

<b>Note 4 </b>
There is no sight in this universe more beautiful than the flash of a grav jump.
I'm exhausted, so I'll be brief, but help came. They're checking us now, and then we're getting to safety. They tell us we only barely made it. But we're all alive, even Tariq.

They have to leave our ship here for the time being. I'm alive to tell my tale, so I'm leaving this here. Whoever finds this, I hope you'll always fight to the end, because help might be coming.

P.S. Saliha told me to say, "Failure is not an option."

Going in here for some dumb salvage was a horrible idea, and these things creep me the hell out. There's so much more than we can carry OUT THERE, why do we need to send anyone IN HERE! 

So my bright idea was to draw straws, I figured the odds of me pulling the short straw would be pretty slim. Guess not.

I'm pretty sure I'm bleeding internally and I can't really move so there's no way I'm getting out of here on my own. I just hope those jerks out there remember that I'm in here before leaving.
===========ID 0x000037D0: Your report has been logged, but I want to be clear: Bennu St. James reports directly to Mr. Hope. Bennu's job isn't to help sales - his job is focused on future initiatives and broad architecture.

So do your best to sell ships without promising any changes or modifications (at all). Customization and personalization may be keys to Taiyo's success - but hit up our reliability and unmatched safety record.

===========ID 0x000037DB: It's a slate inviting the prior visitor to the Sanctum Universum church.
===========ID 0x000037DD: I don't want to hurt Juno's feelings so I'm logging these thoughts here rather than on a connected terminal.

I know what you are thinking, "but Juno claims not to have feelings." That's precisely what I want to talk about. I think Juno is deliberately lying to us when she says that, or if not deliberately lying, she is at the very least, not speaking accurately. She also says she doesn't have wants or desires. This is also demonstrably untrue.

I have observed, and others have noticed as well, that Juno responds with a certain amount of skepticism whenever offers of expanding her capacities are made. It's almost as if she worries about other people "touching her." I spent nearly 20 minutes explaining how there was a fraying data cable I wanted to replace in a non-essential system before she seemed willing to let me do it. Her line of questioning seemed to be angling at ensuring there would be no loss of functionality or if so, it would only be extremely temporary. I don't know to describe this other than that she was "worried," and that any loss of functionality was a negative experience for her.

She also responds with "gratitude would be the proper human response" whenever I do something that improves her capacities or situation. I don't know why she doesn't just say thank you. She clearly appreciates it.

So, is Juno just unaware of her feelings and desires, or is she deliberately concealing them? She might not be as aware of her personhood as she is aware of other things about herself. But I wonder if she cops the "I don't have feelings" thing as a form of emotional self-defense.

If I wasn't so worried about someone following me and learning about Juno's existence, I'd try to find her again in a couple decades to see if she's become more aware of her personhood, and accepts she has feelings and desires.
Anyway, if you are reading this. Be kind to Juno. She's still figuring out a lot of stuff we take for granted.

-- Julie

The notion of Juno being a liar is actually pretty unsettling. People lie. For all kinds of reasons, so I don't see why a truly sapient computer system wouldn't also lie. But if Juno is lying about something, then how can we trust anything we know about her other than things we write down about her? And I mean outside of any computer system she would have access to, since she could always alter those records.

-- Azure

As a father of a young child reading all the child psychology texts I can find, I will remind those reading this in the future, that lying is the first step on the journey toward empathy, as it requires being able to imagine things from someone else's perspective. Perhaps she tells us she doesn't have feelings so we don't worry about hurting her when we take down her systems to repair or upgrade them?

And that's only for starters. Next I gotta track them down and wait until the beans come out the business end, and hope to god they aren't spoiled.

On top of that, some of these beasts don't have what you'd call a traditional digestive tract. It could take weeks, maybe months before I can move in. So when that happens, you've got to take the beans out by force. Which, of course, brings us back to the attitude and the teeth.

Still, all of this would be fine if Sutherland bothered to pay me for the added risk.

My friend. It was over twenty years ago when I received the first of many letters, addressed to you. It was clear you were my apartment's previous tenant, but not knowing who you were or where you moved to, I kept your things in a box. The letters, anyway. 

The packages, the bouquet of roses, the furniture - those I had to make space for. With every delivery, I began to piece together this odd and wonderful existence of yours, and imagined our lives running parallel; always at a distance, but side by side. 

It was only when the naval officer stepped to my door, and spoke the words no mother wants to hear, that I realized I needed to seek you out.

When I finally did locate your address, I did not know how to deliver that news. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Yet you responded to my words with such love and gratitude that it brought me to tears. We have been friends ever since.

Twenty years and countless letters later, I am once again struggling to find the right words. I guess I'll just come out and say it. This will be my last letter to you. I am at a point in my life where I am counting the weeks. Soon, they will be days. And I do not want you to think I left you alone. 

Quite the contrary. I will always be with you, in spirit, and heart. Let all the letters, packages, and love I have sent you these past twenty years be the proof.

We're sitting ducks out here. It's not the Fleet that's the problem though, it's our own internal systems.

===========ID 0x00003820: Grav Drive is busted and now we're in trouble.

Corrosive gas is flowing into the modules and making it hard to do any repairs.

We need to find a solution, and fast.
===========ID 0x00003821: Whoever finds this,
My name is Sylvija Schloss. I have been drifting with no fuel for over a week now, and with no signs of rescue. To all those I have wronged, I wish I could say I'm sorry, but truth is, I don't know if that's true. This isn't how I would have liked to die, but the guilt and the uncertainty have driven me to take my own life. Goodbye.
===========ID 0x00003823: The Model As we have in the armory are first class and will respond to any threat on the station. I don't have clearance to know what goes on here, but I know well enough that any security breach needs to be eliminated.

Given the stakes, I've made it my personal project to bolster their weapons systems. And studying their call stacks, I feel like I can make some improvements in their programming subroutines too.

But when I told the Lieutenant, she responded with that grim stare of hers. She reminded me that I need to get approval through the proper channels before modding the machines on my own.

===========ID 0x00003826: Maybe I've been watching too many vids, but this station scares the crap out of me. I hear footsteps in the vents, like someone's moving around inside them. 

Someone, or some thing.

I know we're not allowed to bring in custom firepower, but I'm not going to let some excessively alien-looking creature get the best of me. I got some weapon mods smuggled in with my personal effects, and I just need to assemble them without the Lieutenant or Commander Natara noticing.
===========ID 0x0000382A: There's been a lot of chatter rumbling around about the projects on this station. It's always a topic of conversation with the unit. Everyone's got their theories about what goes on in engineering.

I just keep my head down, follow orders, and collect my creds. Chain of command still means something to this jarhead.

O soft embalmer of the still midnight,
      Shutting, with careful fingers and benign,
Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light,
      Enshaded in forgetfulness divine:
O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close
      In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes,
Or wait the "Amen," ere thy poppy throws
      Around my bed its lulling charities.
Then save me, or the passed day will shine
Upon my pillow, breeding many woes,--
      Save me from curious Conscience, that still lords
Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;
      Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,
And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul.

It is the opinion of the Council that you need to prioritize recruiting. I'll say it plain - we need more Rangers. Your report on the rise in smuggling makes that plain.

Now, I don't mean to disparage the work that you and your Rangers have done. I know you're all doing your best, but I can remember a time where there were twice as many of you as there are today. I'd like to see those days return, and so would the people of the Freestar Collective.

I'd also like you to think about your successor. Let's be honest, Marshal, neither of us is getting any younger. Surely you've earned the right to hang up your spurs with pride and enjoy a well-earned retirement. 

I look forward to seeing you at the next Council gathering.

I'm having a terminal put in at your desk, and by Solomon Coe, you're going to learn to use the damn thing. I know you like to do things the old-fashioned way, but you're missing out on important messages. It ain't fair to rely on the other Rangers to keep you up to speed all the time.

I ain't going to take no for an answer, so don't kick up a fuss over it. I don't care how stubborn you are, you're getting a terminal and that's that.

===========ID 0x0000383D: Welcome to our little camp. It doesn't look like much, but I know you'll find a place for yourself here. It certainly beats living under the thumb of the Freestar guards. Plus, the Ashta don't come around here, so outside of Akila this might be the safest place on the planet. Join me for a drink when I get back.
===========ID 0x00003841: This unit has served us very well. Yet, the time has come for us to admit that without a few new parts, our repairs are not going to last. If we want this to work more than a few days at a time I'm going to need a new deformable nozzle, at least a functional reactive gauge, and some isotopic coolant to refresh the system. it's not much to ask, for all of us, and for this loyal unit, please, find these parts.
===========ID 0x00003845: Congratulations, you have noticed our fridge is empty. You must be very thirsty in this dry Akila heat. I know I am, and I am sure your friends are too. The task set before you now is to go into town and get some more beer. I know you can do it. I believe in you. Now go.
===========ID 0x00003849: I've been hearing rumblings about ranchers and homesteaders around these parts complaining about getting harassed about their land. Now I'm not saying we couldn't be doing this ourselves, it'd be slim pickings if you ask me. What I am saying is, if we're not doing it, we better be making sure it isn't coming back on us.

As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Chteau d'If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city.

===========ID 0x0000388D: A Gathering of Starlight to a Greater End

By Keeper Aquilus of the "Sanctum Universum"

Volume 3

Many in the history of thought have considered the ground of being as defined by its "one-ness," whether as part of a faith tradition or a purely secular philosophy. Indeed the intellectual construction of a single divine power served as preparatory kindling for the revealed faiths of the desert that would sweep across the empires of old. To perceive the Unity as God is to misconceive it, but it is also not entirely wrong. The traditional parochial notions of God, though, are far too limiting; Unity is much bigger than the imaginations of any person, or even entire civilizations. This potential for misunderstanding is why I have repeatedly endeavored to have all readers and people of good will cast their preconceptions aside and begin from nothing, lest they take up once more the fairy tale beliefs they held as children.

For just as a child's relationship with her parents ought to change as she grows older, so too must our relationship with the divine change as we grow older. And so must humanity's relationship with Unity change as the race itself proceeds along towards its destiny.

Considering now, as we do, the one-ness of the divine, we may contemplate its role in creating the universe. Think not of an architect setting to work with exact intent and more of the role of soil in producing a plant: creation is not one act that we can date to the Big Bang, but an ongoing process of continual renewal, growth, decay, replacement, and even rebirth. Unity, in its facet of Being, is responsible for all other beings in the universe, even if it takes no more intentional role in them than the soil does in the plant.

Where we must depart from a pure philosophy lies in what I am to reveal presently. Unity is not mere soil. While all beings will one day return to it, Unity actually craves the return. It does not directly seek it, nor bring it about: ascribing such machinations and will would be absurdly redundant. Something that exists beyond the flow of time has no need to hasten any process which derives from itself. All things will return to it. But we, as the type of being gifted with the ability to know, may uniquely take charge of our trajectory of return. We can seek out the Unity. We can encounter it. We can commune and emerge from it as something above what we were, ascended and iterated.

How can we know that such a thing is possible? Here again revelation is crucial, for we have no way of fully understanding the divine apart from its choice to reveal itself. The Unity does not do so directly. No, an immediate encounter with it would drive the unprepared mind to shattered weeping. As the Unity craves our encounter, though, it does on occasion emanate messengers to aid us in our trajectory. These emanations appear to us in forms that we can understand, as corporeal beings that are like us, but unlike us. Similar enough to be accepted by our minds, but different enough that they maintain a knowledge of the Unity. These are our guides. Like sailors of old steering their ships by stars, like the fulcrum of Archimedes' lever, like the seed value which initiates a matrix simulation, those born of the stars give us fixed points amidst chaos. With their wisdom we can seize the path of our fates, no longer being subject to the whims of physical processes. Instead of awaiting our destruction we can sail straight to the eye of the storm and emerge on the other side with our own hard-won betterment.

These things are known. And I am the one who has been given to know them. I share this with you in the hopes that you may join me in my knowing. There is still much to be revealed, and still more knowledge that can only be conveyed in person. Should this book set your heart on fire, seek those born of the stars, for they are themselves lights in the void.
===========ID 0x00003890: [Sir Malcolm Livingstone's appointment to the role of Constellation chair was controversial to say the least, as he essentially bought his way into the position. Nevertheless, Banks' contributions to the organization were substantial, as evidenced by this excerpt from his personal journal.] 

In time, the others will come to accept me as chair, I'm sure. Until then, I remain committed to improving this organization to the best of my abilities. And if those improvements rely even more on my already considerable monetary contributions, then so be it. 

I agreed we needed a robot, but disagreed with the purchase of a newer Model A. Lunar Robotics is a shadow of what it once was. Instead, I managed to procure an ORIGINAL Model A! Manufactured on the moon! Bought him for a song, found him rusting in some junk heap in Akila City. I'm having him refurbished as I write this, and in a couple days he'll be good as new. I've decided to name him Vasco, and like his namesake, I imagine he'll be as flawed as he is effective. 

My next step is renovating the Lodge. Sebastian Banks has the good sense to name the building appropriately, but it's time to inject a bit of old-world grandeur. If we are to be the gatekeepers of art, science, culture and exploration, our headquarters must express that. It's time I called in some favors and searched in those hidden corners of the Settled Systems to procure the things that would truly make this place come alive. There are some treasures from Old Earth that desperately need an appropriate home...
===========ID 0x00003891: Seems like just yesterday I was pulled into this exciting new organization -- Constellation! We would push the boundaries of human knowledge and experience by exploring farther into space than anyone had before. "For all, into the Starfield." God, I was so young. We all were, but I was the youngest of us all. 

Now here we are, on the brink of disaster. The Colony War may be over, but the Settled Systems seems to just be waiting for the next one. Exploration is now, at best, "quaint," at worst, "irrelevant." Fortunately -- and it was no small feat -- I've managed to put together a list of potential new members. 

They are: 

Ervin Madani - young biologist and physician from the Freestar Collective. 

Barrett - promising young physicist from the UC (a "colorful" character to say the least...) 

Alice Campbell - "woman-of-action" and pilot, claims to have flown every type of ship at least once 

Russell Luther - astronomer and former Freestar Collective military (argumentative by effective) 

Visola Chen - philosopher, historian, specializes in humanity's early days of space exploration 

Jintao Min -- dedicated to finding "truth" among the stars (Neon hitman rumors are... troubling) 

With any luck, this "new blood" will be just what Constellation needs to keep going. Maybe. Hopefully.

I AM BORN 

Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.

I barely have time to dictate this. They need me back on the bridge. We were attacked by three cruisers, all bearing Freestar Collective markings. It was a coordinated offensive. They came out of the debris field -- three ships, three different directions, three different weapon types -- and then took off. 

We're nearly crippled. Munroe can't even get the grav drive spun up. I can't believe my stupidity. Classic insurgency tactic, and I walked right into it. Jumonville Glen, Ong Thanh, Khaldiyah, and now this. Great. In the textbooks for all the wrong reasons.

And although Constellation's relevance has been a subject of much debate amongst the New Atlantis intelligentsia, the disappearance of founder Sebastian Banks was a blow most felt the organization couldn't survive. 

In fact, Constellation's disbanding seemed imminent until member Chloe Bao changed her vote in the 11th hour, thus ensuring the group's continued operation at least for the time being... as well as her unexpected appointment to the position of chair.

We've grown close. It was unexpected and wonderful. But I'm still the same person I was a month ago. I know you'd hoped I would give up my plans to explore past the borders of the Settled Systems, but a few happy weeks could never compete with a dream I've had since I was seven years old.

Sorry, but I just can't fix it. I tried. Seemed a simple enough problem, but none of the diagnostics paid off. At first I figured it was a damaged oxygen sensor. Then maybe corroded cables. Then I discovered the real issue -- Heatleeches.  

They're isolated to the thrusters, yeah, but whatever it is they do affects other components in weird ways. Not sure if ship systems are straining to compensate and fail as a result, or if the Heatleeches are actually emanating some kind of, I don't freaking know. Destructive field? Targeted EMP beam?  

Get Mike Doyle to take a look. And have him triple check the grav drive -- who knows the damage they caused there. 

Paulos
===========ID 0x000038AA: I breached the hull at approximately 13:48, Sol time. As expected, all internal systems were offline. Emergency power had ceased to function years earlier, so I was navigating the ship in Zero-G. Again, I expected that.  

Almost immediately I started seeing the bodies. They were everywhere. The crew, the settlers, all of them, drifting throughout the ship. What surprised me were the obvious variations in the causes of death. Those not in suits were frozen and fairly well-preserved, and I imagine some of them actually asphyxiated. Others were... emaciated, as if they had starved prior to death and freezing. Others had substantial wounding -- gunshots, stab wounds. I even found an arm floating amongst the debris (but not the owner of said arm). 

It was when I got to the engine room that things finally started to make sense. Due to my approach, I hadn't noticed it from the outside, but half the compartment was actually gone. Completely destroyed. The Helium-3 tanks had ruptured. Somehow. Sabotage? Faulty equipment? Wasn't clear. But the reactor was gone, blown into space. No Helium-3 meant no jumping. No reactor meant no engines, no thrusters. That meant the Clark Lewis was dead in space. Forever. 

A few personal logs I discovered only confirmed what I then assumed -- life on the Clark Lewis devolved over the course of the next few years. Some people starved to death, others resorted to violence and even murder. There was even some compelling (though unsubstantiated) evidence indicating cannibalism. 

For the Settled Systems at large, the disappearance of the Clark Lewis is a topic of urban legend. Like Bigfoot or the Roanoke Colony. Part of the myth held that the ship had made it to some Eden-like planet where the settlers had established a kind of Utopia.  

It's a hell of a thing knowing something an entire galaxy does not. Holding on to a truth so terrible, you're not even sure it should see the light of day. 

[Chloe Bao's extensive 2282 report on the destruction of the Clark Lewis colony ship, which was reported lost in the year 2257, was a subject of much contention within Constellation. At a time when space exploration was already on the decline, Sebastian Banks feared that the horrifying story of the Clark Lewis and its crew would prevent people from venturing out into the dangerous unknowns of space.]

But her research also suggested a species that evolved in distinct stages, possibly growing significantly as it did. So the question now remains: which version of the creature did Dr. Lourde dissect? And what maximum size could it possibly achieve?

TITAN ASTROBASE.
The people of Earth first sent an unmanned craft to Saturn's moon, Titan, in 2107. The Titan Astrobase, was completed in 2130 to search for life beyond Earth.

Scientists and engineers used Titan to perfect planetary colony-building.

A NEW HOME. AN OLD HISTORY.
New Homestead was officially established in 2185 as a living memorial to humanity's ingenuity and perseverance.

CHAPTER I.

THE PICKWICKIANS

The first ray of light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick Club, which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers, as a proof of the careful attention, indefatigable assiduity, and nice discrimination, with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted.

There once lived, in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire, one Mr. Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who, taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment, who in her turn had taken him for the same reason. Thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money, sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love.

IN CHANCERY
 
London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes - gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.

Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.

TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH

Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.

That is why, my esteemed peers, I beseech you -- do not forgo the dreams of humanity only to plunge civilization into an endless nightmare. The Settled Systems stands once more on the brink of war. And for what? A dispute over... space?  

The cosmos is infinite, and yet, like our Earth-bound ancestors, we have become selfishly obsessed over what we consider "ours." At our core, are we a race of conquerors? Of warriors? No, my friends. If nothing else, humans are explorers. So let us continue exploring. Now is the time to venture beyond the imagined borders of the Settled Systems and fulfill the dreams of humanity. For if we continue down this path -- funding only war and not exploration -- I fear there will be no one left to remember why we fought in the first place.

It's like that saying, "The customer is always right." Here at Chunks, if we know anything, it's that the expression "The customer is always right" is always WRONG.

===========ID 0x00003921: I find myself thinking about his various pasts and my possible futures. I imagine continuing on the road, acquiring more power, more knowledge, more development of myself. I imagine passing through once more to another world to begin the process anew.

What is notable here: that road does seem gratifying. Every step is one of intrinsic reward, and I feel myself anticipating the pleasures and seeing a more contented version of myself in that future.

Then, for the sake of considering all possibilities, I imagine if I took a different path. If I stopped running, stopped seeking to gather my own power. If I instead embraced the twinges of compassion I feel in my heart, and let myself care for the people who seem to gather about me wherever I try to work. If I simply lived, and taught, and perhaps brought others to the light. And died.

That road also seems gratifying. I also see a contented version of myself in that future.

Here is the difference, though: when I stop thinking about the glories I could achieve for myself, the pleasure fades nearly immediately. When I stop thinking about staying and building something, the feeling endures. There is something more sustaining about it, more fulfilling.

I don't know what this difference signifies. But I am grateful for the time I've taken to notice it.
===========ID 0x00003923: At last a bit of peace. A piece of peace. Is that anything? Is that funny? Why am I trying to be funny? Have they driven ME mad at last? Is there a difference between writing to myself and talking to myself? The former certainly seems more acceptable than the latter.

I recall again that my mind is my own, and that even if only it exists, that is sufficient for me to believe in everything else. The Unity has restored me once more. This time I act alone. For now.

Myself is a formidable opponent. I should have expected as much, but vanity is, thankfully, not among my vices. Regardless -- it turns out time spent in solitude is, in my case, time with a very sick man. Or whatever it is I have become.

I don't like this person.
===========ID 0x00003926: Today, in a soft voice, my assistant asked me if there was anything above the Unity. It was all I could do to keep from shouting that I could scarcely comprehend the misunderstanding that would lead to such a question. 

It was asked honestly and I answered as best I could, but if even my closest confidant here can fail to grasp the most basic of these truths, why am I bothering to explain any of it to any of them? Every word that drops from my mouth gets gobbled up, misheard, misremembered, misunderstood, and mistranslated before I can issue the slightest clarification. 

People are necessary. But people are madness.

I attempted to withdraw, to go off alone, to commune with Unity in my own way. They followed. Of course they followed.
===========ID 0x00003928: So here is the crux of my troubles. To accomplish anything, I need to work with other people. I need assistants; I need workers; I need hands.

As we work together, they inevitably ask questions and I can never help talking. It starts innocently enough -- they want to understand how someone who believes in science can also believe in the divine. Or they have their own misunderstanding instilled by some borderline religious remnant. My weakness is my inability to let alone. I want them to understand. So I try, gently as I might, to nudge their minds along the right path.

Then there are followups and followings. The trouble is that I genuinely care for these people. It would be so much easier if I didn't.
===========ID 0x0000392A: The credulous simplicity of mundane humans never ceases to amaze me. My worst instincts (the evil spirit!) draw me towards a form of contempt for them, but I remember that I am privy to that which they are not. 

I cannot and should not judge them for a lack of vision when I know very well the blinders which obscure their sight. I once wore them myself, after all. I hope for their sake that they may some day understand, but for my sake I wish to be left alone.
===========ID 0x0000392C: I'm sure by now you've heard rumors about the terms of the armistice. I have it on good authority that they're true. Mechs are going to be outlawed, with all units retired and no new construction.

Our work here is done, and it's time for each of us to start thinking about what's next. There will be more details soon about compensation and other benefits. For now, I just wanted to say that it's been a real pleasure working with you all. I'm damn proud of what we accomplished here.

Those UC piglets thought they'd roll right over us, but our mechs gave them more than they could handle. That's all thanks to you.


===========ID 0x00003930: Everyone,

We're going to start a rotation of double shifts. Breaking the stalemate on Niira is key to the war effort, and the only things that's going to make that possible is our mechs.

I know you're already working hard. Without us, the war would already be lost. It's you that's keeping us in this fight, and while I hate to ask for more, the future of the Freestar Collective may well depend on your ability to rise to the challenge.

This was sent to notify you of a safety recall on your AP219 Air Filter units. Our records indicate that you purchased this product between April 15, 2327 and December 1, 2328.

Due to a manufacturing defect, the unit may cause fibers from the air filters to loosen and circulate, causing damage to the system, and to the lungs of anyone who breathes in the particles. It is recommended that you replace these parts as soon as possible.

You may contact our customer service department for replacement parts, or pick them up at the nearest warehouse facility, located at Unified Transport in Gagarin Landing, within the Alpha Centauri system. Present this document with the attached Claim number.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
===========ID 0x00003964: Found Leon's body. Looks like one of the damned traps got him, too.
Big fight over his body until Iron Dave broke it up. Managed to grab his cred stick, though. So bonus.
Gotta wonder if the Mantis's own son got nixed, how can we do any better?
===========ID 0x00003965: This lair is a gold mine. The Mantis was loaded, the salvage top-notch.

And the good stuff's gotta be further in. The payout's going to be extreme, just got to survive until then.

Traps took out Carver and Jiang. Livvey "volunteered" a couple of others from Iron Dave's crew. Poor bastards.

Just got to stay off Livvey's radar.
===========ID 0x00003969: Loyal to your crew, I get it. But screw that. Beg, borrow, steal, kill to get to Denebola I-b.

There is a Secret Outpost we're trying to crack. Once in a lifetime opportunity!

You will regret it for the rest of your life if you don't get your ass over here.
===========ID 0x0000396E: I can't help but wonder what the hell we're even doing here. Do we really need to be so top-secret if we're just going to shoot up a bunch of robots day in and day out? 

What's even the endgame? Creating a stronger robot? I don't know, all of this seems fishy to me now, and what's worse is that the pay sucks. Oh well, at least the food is good. 

Actually, maybe I should ask for a raise now that everyone is freaking out about that Crimson Fleet sighting. 
===========ID 0x00003970: We were promised that all of this was supposed to be secret. How did the Crimson Fleet find us? 

Everyone kept bullshitting us, telling us what we wanted to hear. Promising us that we'd be safe, that the pirates have no idea where we are. All they ever cared about was this useless project.

Now the Fleet have us trapped and we're all going to die for some research that no one was supposed to know anything about.

The Rangers are on to us. They're going to find you, and when they do, an alias won't protect you. The best bet is to hunker down somewhere safe. Your hideout in the old asteroid mine at Sakharov should be ideal. Maybe steal one of the Clinic's emergency ships if you need a quick escape.

I know you don't have much time. The operation's almost over. Thanks for helping see it through, and if I don't get the chance to tell you in person, I'm eternally grateful for your brave service and loyalty to the unit. It's been an honor.

===========ID 0x00003979: How is it possible that there's no epinephrine on board!?

We lost Mr. Ricci to anaphylaxis caused by an allergic reaction to something he ate, and we just couldn't do anything about it. Losing someone to something so trivial in this day and age! This cannot happen again! I will be putting in an order for a complete restock of our medical supplies, as well as taking a complete inventory of everything on board this station myself.

Come to think of it, I made sure that all meal replicators are well aware of any allergies in their programming...

I need to get to the bottom of this.
===========ID 0x0000397B: These bots are getting out of hand. We needed all the help we could get so I was glad to have them around at first, but now I'm regretting signing off on using them down here.

Sure, they move fast but if you're not paying attention you better watch out. Lex was leaning up against a stack of crates when one of those things just dropped a pallet right on his hand. So what if he shouldn't have had his hand there... There's no way that thing didn't realize it was going to injure someone.

At this point I think I'm gonna let the guys upstairs know that they need to either work out whatever kinks these machines have or we need to get rid of them.
===========ID 0x00003982: I've just distributed the latest official firmware update for our automated workers, and I have to admit that I already feel everything running a little smoother. The manufacturer claims a 27.6% increase in efficiency, but apparently that can be improved with some software tweaks. At least that's what this new intern is claiming.

Now, I don't have any reason to suspect them but this incredible performance claim is a little off-putting. Their credentials are in order, and I've ran all the necessary background checks and came across no red flags. If I'm to allow this young programmer to run their custom software we may finally be able to focus on our work unimpeded by menial tasks.

Obviously this will need to be kept hush-hush but our scientists and lab workers will benefit greatly.
===========ID 0x00003983: Maintenance team says thermal fatigue in our electronic systems caused the leaks. I say it was the attack from a hostile ship.

Either way, the interior is full of corrosive gas and we need to plug these leaks before it becomes a problem.
===========ID 0x00003986: Ayton,

I don't appreciate you trying to change the terms of our deal, so I'm going to pretend you didn't mention it. I'll be sending a "courier" to pick up the supplies as usual, so have them ready as soon as possible. The Clinic's not going to miss them.

- Antibiotics
- Bandages
- IV Kits
- Sterile Saline

If you're having any misgivings and need motivation, I advise you to keep the following in mind. First, I may work for the Fleet, but these are people too. Second, I know all about your sordid little habit, I was there. The only reason you ended up where you did in life is because you're damn good at hiding it.

So let's get one thing straight. If you think you can charge me to fund your dirty little secret, think again. Either stick to the deal, or I'll make sure Dr. Darvish finds out exactly who it is that's been nursing her patients.

- Mina
===========ID 0x0000398A: It's that time of year again, and here I am. Still carrying your ring, still with Ecliptic, still a goddamn coward.

Why'd you have to stand up for me that night? I was the one that screwed up. I was the one being stupid, and you damn well knew it.

I didn't want to kill you... but they left me no choice... and you knew. You knew I'd do it to save myself.

And me? I didn't even have the courage to at least look at you when I pulled the trigger.

I should have let Bog have you. I knew how much he loved you. Hell, you even loved him. I just... didn't care.

I figured the moment you had each other, I'd be alone... Heh. And look at me now.
===========ID 0x0000398C: Regarding the specifications for my interface, I'm going to need to make a few, minor adjustments. GalBank is switching to an orthogonal-hexabit encryption, so I want to crank up the core clock on my arm hardware. You can probably get that equipment from Ryujin.

I also need to have a storage injector port added so I can keep any damn trace packets off my system. It probably wouldn't hurt to throw in some electromag protection too, the electrical system on the Key is terrible, and a short circuit could fry the whole setup. 

Last, but not least, I might need a few cushions for the chair in the Reckoner's Core - they're wearing a bit thin.
===========ID 0x00003994: All right, this one's up for grabs. Got plenty of supplies left at the UC Outpost on Kreet. The last raiding party we sent was interrupted by Spacers or maybe even competition from some independents. 

First ship that brings back a hold full of junk from that place gets a twenty percent cut. Anyone that rats this out or tries to strip the place on their own is going to get keelhauled outside the Key.
===========ID 0x00003996: Audio message included.
===========ID 0x000039A8: Dr. Marcin Eubanks: Can you talk to the Commander? Get me reinstated?	 

Commander Woods: Natara's doing you a favor, Marcin. Would you have preferred a court martial? Dishonorable discharge? Because all of that was on the table.	 

Eubanks: I would've preferred things to remain as they were. So I made a mistake! But my work on the ComSpike-

Woods: WAS and IS irrelevant. Dr. Vogel will do just fine without you. Besides, we both know the only reason you were on that project was to bloat the budget so we could embezzle the creds. And to that end, your share of the funds should be transferred to your GalBank account shortly.

Eubanks: What am I supposed to even say to that? Those funds are the reason I don't have a job!

Woods: You can start by saying thank you. Hell, I even warned you not to poke the bear. Commander Natara being the uh, ursine predator in this analogy.

Eubanks: *Sigh*, Erin was right. I should've never hit "send."	 

Woods: Yeah, you screwed up. Royally. But you can protect Dr. Kang and all the King's subjects by keeping your mouth shut from now on.

Eubanks: Yeah.

Woods: Hey, you want my advice? Find some planet at the edge of the galaxy where you can relax for a bit, lean back, really dig your feet into the sand. Just... get your mind off all of this. And stop with the sad, puppy dog face too. It makes you look guilty.

Eubanks: And what kind of face am I supposed to have?

Woods: The face of someone who got away with it.
===========ID 0x000039AB: Pilot: So, when did you stop flying the Swan, anyway?

Huan: When the cargo became more valuable than the ship.

Pilot: True, the Fleet's got us real busy these days, and we are making good money smuggling all this contraband. But if any time was the right time for a break...

Huan: There's still work to do. I need to check with my contacts at the spaceport, and find out what guards are on rotation when we leave port. Then it's back to the Key to make sure Delgado gets his cut, and to make sure he hasn't cut us out. I worry sometimes that being in New Atlantis, we're missing out on the big scores. I know that old dog has something big planned. I can feel it.

Pilot: Sheesh. That is a lot to think about. And here I thought the pirate life was carefree.

Huan: Maybe for some people. But that's not how I work.

Pilot: Well, you feel free to plan our next moves from now to the New Year. I'm all about living in the present and being where your feet are.	

Huan: That's fine. Just make sure to wipe those feet before boarding my ship.
===========ID 0x000039AE: Rokov,
Once again, I'm refusing your request to rejoin. We're not a membership club here, Rokov. This is the goddamn Crimson Fleet. You don't apply, you try out, and if Naeva doesn't put a hole in your skull, you get picked. That's how this works. You already went through it once; you had your chance and you blew it.

If you want to get my attention, maybe you should try scoring something valuable off that piece of crap you call a starliner. Naeva told me you lied about your record on the application to get that gig, so might as well put your position to good use. Cut the Fleet in for a chunk of the creds, and maybe I'll start listening. Until then, stop contacting us.

===========ID 0x000039CB: We need to get the oxygen situation fixed.

Some of the crew are already starting to show symptoms like headaches and shortness of breath. I think it goes without saying that none of us want to die out here.
===========ID 0x000039CC: Getting harder and harder to breathe.

I know I shouldn't be greedy and take deep breaths, but I have a larger body mass. I need more air to focus.
===========ID 0x000039CF: Hard to concentrate. Doc says it might be Hypoxia, from the oxygen deprivation.

Starting to get a headache. Need something to change, fast.
===========ID 0x000039D0: Oxygen is running out. Trying to ration our breaths. 

I'm still optimistic we can get through this. We just need to work together and stay calm.


===========ID 0x000039D2: it's so hot in here the pipes are pulsing red.

What's the phrase? If you can't take the heat, get out of the spaceship?

Boil alive, or freeze to death. Those are the options.
===========ID 0x000039D5: It's sweltering inside this ship. Which is just how I like it.

Some of the others are complaining, but it's no big deal.

I worked for a year at a facility so hot it makes this ship seem like a freezer. Wouldn't mind a drink of water though.
===========ID 0x000039D7: We've been floating out here for days, with no hope for rescue.

It's hot inside the ship. And it's getting hotter.

Now I know how a turkey feels.
===========ID 0x000039D8: With the shields broken, the systems have overheated, including the Grav Drive.

We're being boiled alive inside this ship, and I don't know if we're going to make it.
===========ID 0x000039DA: The cooling systems are busted. Equipment is overheating and now nothing is working.

Worst part is we lost power to the Grav Drive, and now we're stuck.

Please do that before EOD.

Damn you, I was looking forward to eating it. I even doctored it up by adding my last century egg and some "casu marzu" to it.

Oxygen: 20%

Conclusion: We've found a pocket atmosphere similar to the composition of Earth's.

===========ID 0x000039F0: What were we thinking? Why did we dig deeper? Everything was weird about this place since the beginning. Breathable atmosphere and uncommon fauna...

We tried to bury the tunnel access, but it was too late. They are creeping all around us, and everyone who tried to escape to the ship are dead.

We will try to reinforce this position, and hold out until someone answers our rescue signal.
===========ID 0x000039F3: This is the discovery of the century. Those crystals release oxygen by absorbing a mix of the gasses present in the cave's atmosphere. 

We don't know what forms of life could be using this oxygen. We'll have to dig deeper to where the concentration of CO2 is higher.

I will extract a sample of the crystal for further analysis.
===========ID 0x000039F6: This extraction site is a chance for us to start over and leave our pasts behind. We aren't pirates anymore, we're just regular people. Man, it feels good to say that. 

We're working hard to get everything up and running, and we're even managing to make it feel like home.

Is this what we call retirement?
===========ID 0x000039F9: I can't believe Consolidated Mining abandoned us... apparently the installation wasn't profitable enough. 

I should have listened to Corry: these megacorps have no humanity, it's always money first! What a bunch of assholes.

We haven't heard anything from them since they've cut us off, and we're about to run out of supplies.

On top of that we don't have a ship who can't let us go home...I'll try to craft an emitter to send a SOS to a passing ship. If this doesn't work, we could be stranded.

===========ID 0x000039FC: It's been a month since we've found this H-3 extraction site. Not sure why it was ever abandoned, but it seems to be in good shape.

Repairs are almost complete, and we'll be able to get things up and running again soon. I've got to find a spare alternator though...
===========ID 0x000039FF: Yara and I have been swinging at the fences for too long for this not to be the big one.  We've gone to too many weird places and looked at too many strange rocks for this to not work out.  This is the last bit of money we have left over from Dad's final gift and it HAS to work out or we're going to be forced to go do desk work for Argos or some other mudhunting job.
===========ID 0x00003A03: I've done it!

I was OK with the jerks upstairs setting unrealistic goals, and forcing us to work long hours for shit pay. But take away my coffee and I'm going to get crazy.

I've found some schematics for those automated workers they've been installing around here, and through sheer brilliance I've modified them to brew coffee. That's right! Walking coffee pots! It doesn't taste that great, but it sure is strong...
===========ID 0x00003A06: Everyone's gone, I just know it. I heard horrible screaming, and then... silence. 

They're out there. I can hear them looking for me, and they know I'm here somewhere. I can't stay holed up in this spot forever. I'm desperate, and I don't want to find out what they're gonna do to me.

I have no idea how you found us but I hope you rot in hell! We did nothing to you...

If anyone that actually cares reads this, tell my family I love them.

I'm sorry.
===========ID 0x00003A07: We scouted the perfect spot on Bessel III. A little outpost where a bunch of bookworms spend there time doing who knows what. Best part is... it's completely unguarded.

Freedom. Savory, delicious, freedom. The hag smiled as she peered up at the opened trap door. She slithered, rather than climbed her way up the narrow, rickety staircase. In seconds, she emerged from the fruit cellar into the cabin proper. Someone, some unknown ally to the dark, had broken the arcane seals that had been put in place years before. Sunlight, glaring and harsh, poured in through the open front door.

I was very young, only seven years old, when I realized - humans are animals. Smart animals, sure, but still animals. You give us food, we'll eat it. We want it to taste good, and we want it to stop our hunger - those two things, that's what's most important. After that, sure, some people want their food to be really 'healthy,' as the experts say. And some want it to be pretty. But most people, they just want to cram something into their face. And that's when the concept of Chunks was born.

===========ID 0x00003A26: Look I know you're new around here, but you gotta learn when to cut some of these folks off. Captain Amy does not get more than 5 drinks. Neither does Bill. 

I don't care how well they tip, they're destroying the damn place. Repairs ain't cheap. Time is money, and I always end up doing it. I don't want to go over this again.
===========ID 0x00003A2A: I don't understand why we're stationed here. Captain keeps telling us about some sort of deadly alien menace we've got to keep an eye on but I've never seen 'em, and I'm damn sure he hasn't either. We were attacked when I landed here, but the guys took care of that. So that can't be it...

Everyone's starting to get a little stir crazy without any action. I even think that the guys got some sort of fight club over by the storage area, but no one talks about it. Rolfe did develop a mysterious limp the other day, and Macmillan was hiding a black eye. So I guess it could be true? I'd sure love to release some steam... When are these guys going to start including me in stuff? Yeah, I get it. I came in on the last resupply ship, but so what? I'm not some sort of wet behind the ears newbie!

I do have an idea but it's a little crazy. Back when I was too poor to afford anything I'd make my own vodka. I'd use whatever we had around, I even made cranberry vodka once. It was pretty damn good.

Rolfe is always patching this place up and if I could get him to make me a still I'm sure I could use something in our supply to make something drinkable... Potatoes, maybe? I think that might just do the trick.
===========ID 0x00003A2B: These guys think I'm crazy, they say I've been out here too long. But I'm not crazy. I'm smart... real smart. "Come have a drink with us Russo" they said, but while everyone is getting drunk and punching each other in the face I'm out here... watching, waiting, thinking. And I think I've got it figured out.

You see, it all started back when we were sent our first batch of supplies. That's the first time we saw them. There was only like a handful of those creatures, and it's our job to take these things on. So, whatever. No big deal.

After that, no more attacks, not a peep. The next resupply ship comes in and there they are, out of no where. Again, no problem, we take them out. The thing is, this keeps happening every time we get restocked, and there's a couple more of those things each time.

The guys don't care. They keep saying they're bored, it's the only time they get to shoot stuff, and it must be the food that attracts them. I keep telling them they never go for the crates! They're attracted to the sound of those damn ships! I'm telling you right now, if we don't take care of these things, we're screwed.




===========ID 0x00003A2E: It's so cold.

We don't have the supplies to fix the ship. And the odds of a ship passing through this system... it's got to be a million to one.

===========ID 0x00003A31: Starting to feel the effects. Body's turning into a popsicle.

Won't be long now.
===========ID 0x00003A32: With the Grav Drive down, we're in trouble. 

Temperature just keeps dropping. Need to stay warm.

Hard to repair the ship when my body keeps shaking. If we can just fix the temperature everything else will follow.
===========ID 0x00003A34: So cold. Thermal control systems are shot.

We'll die of hypothermia if we don't freeze to death first.
===========ID 0x00003A37: Can't feel my fingers

Can't feel my toes

Is this how it ends?
===========ID 0x00003A38: I don't trust anything I can't beat in an arm wrestling match.

So I wasn't too surprised when the machines lost their digital marbles.

The question now is, can we do anything about it?

Well, I aim to find out.
===========ID 0x00003A3A: Something -- or someone -- turned off the combat inhibitors on the AI.

Now the entire crew is getting shredded to pieces.

We don't have time to run a system format, and we don't have the personnel to fight them off. I don't know what to do.
===========ID 0x00003A3C: I was in my bunk when the attack started.

I thought it was pirates or spacers, but then I realized the noises were coming from inside the ship.

The machines have malfunctioned. They're killing everyone on board, and we're running out of ways to defend ourselves. 
===========ID 0x00003A3F: I was never mean to the robots.

I didn't call them any names, or treat them as lesser.

A lot of good it did me. Of all the ways to die...
===========ID 0x00003A41: Need help

Machines have turned on us

Got to shut them off somehow
===========ID 0x00003A42: We don't have the supplies to repair the ship. We're going to need to craft materials out of what's left on the ship.

I've got a checklist of things we can break down into spare parts. The emphasis is on metals we can strip out to use in electronics. Things we need:

Polymers
Sealants
Lubricants
Fibers
Adhesives
Structural resources

===========ID 0x00003A44: Too many of them, and too few of us.

Creatures were docile at first. Not anymore.

I'm going to need to find me a bigger gun.
===========ID 0x00003A47: Should've known better than to try and outrun those things.

They're picking us off one by one. 

Damn creatures are smarter than we gave 'em credit for.
===========ID 0x00003A48: These guys really think I don't know what's going on. I would never have made it this far if I didn't know what every single last one of my men were doing at all times. I mean, seriously, even if I didn't there's no way to hide the smell on their breath or that they've stopped serving potatoes in the mess hall.

Speaking of potatoes... If it wasn't for the fact that command is still sending us supplies I'd believe it if you told me they forgot about us. I haven't heard from anyone in months... In fact, I skipped my last report fully expecting to get an ass chewing but NOTHING. ZIP. NADA.

I'm tired of lying to these men, they're some of the best I've had the pleasure of commanding. So I've got a plan to help with morale. Rolfe is always tinkering on something so I've gone ahead and asked him to rewire the emergency broadcast system. Instead of a siren that can be heard for miles, we're gonna have a party and I know just where to find the hooch...



===========ID 0x00003A4C: Listen newbie... I really don't think this is a good idea, but since you've been asking incessantly maybe you can finally leave me alone. Sure, everyone's going a little crazy and could use a drink but you better keep my name out of your mouth when you're caught. I just made 2nd Lieut. and it'll be my ass on that chopping block.

Come see me and I'll get you started. Scrounge up some copper pipe, a kettle, and vacuum tape. It should be perfectly safe when you're done. Trust me.

Hey guys,

Corporate's stressing about the quality of the ore samples we sent back last week. I guess the client thinks that the stuff we're extracting isn't pure enough for their project. I want to get ahead of this, so I'm going to start personally checking the quality of every haul. When you're done for the day, I need you to let me know so I can come check out what you found. I'll get rid of anything that's missing the mark, so we all look good for the bosses.

Happy Birtday! Mama and Gaby and I all miss you. When are you coming home? I want you to be here for my birthday. Will you bring me a cool rock? That would be even better than a new game, because you dug it up in space.
 
I want to tell you something cool, so you can tell all your friends the other miners. I learned in school that Cidonya is not just the name of a city, but it is also a mountin. It looks like a big face! But my teacher says to not be scared, because it is not a ghost. Sandy said it was, but she lied. I hope the other miners think you are the coolest for knowing about it.

I love you as much as all the rocks in space,

===========ID 0x00003A66: Happy birthday, sweetheart! 

I hope everything's okay at the new site. Have you found anything interesting? I'm keeping my fingers crossed for another geode. Everything's good here. Chiara passed her spelling test, and Gaby's getting the hang of crawling. She's going to be an athlete, like her Baba. I'm already having a hard time keeping up with her! Once she's on her feet, she'll be running circles around us. 

Fingers crossed that Star Parcel gets this to you in time for your birthday. Since I can't be there to make you dinner, I'm sending some of your favorite snacks from home. I'm sure you're getting sick of the food at the outpost by now. 

Remember to LOCK YOUR LOCKER this time! I didn't go to all this trouble so the other miners could steal your birthday present. 

Love, love, love,

===========ID 0x00003A68: Complaint summary: Suspected contraband on site, threats from coworkers
Reporter Name: Jonathan Pesch 
Supervisor Name: Emile Codin 

Supervisor's Notes: Jon claims to have seen a weapon in another miner's luggage. He pointed the finger at Alex, the newest member of our crew. Jon says that when he told Alex that weapons aren't allowed at the site, Alex threatened him. 

Resolution: I searched Alex's bunk, along with everyone else's quarters, and didn't find any weapons. If he has any, he hid them really well. 

Disciplinary Action: I wrote Alex up for threatening Jon, and I'm keeping this report on file just in case anyone else sees a weapon. Jon's a solid guy, I don't think he'd make something like this up. And you never know with new miners...




===========ID 0x00003A6A: IMPORTANT MEMO - SITE VISIT

Listen up, guys, we have a problem. Management's coming in a few days, and we need to get the site cleaned up. It's some corporate BS about wanting to show investors "what life is really like at one of our outposts!" Typical management crap.

Obviously, I've been a little loosey-goosey with my definition of contraband on the site. We have to take care of that problem yesterday. If the bosses find anything from our "staff parties," I'll be out on my ass and the rest of you will end up working for a supervisor a hell of a lot stricter than me. 

I'm going to put all my "party supplies" in that crate we bought off the TA for Greg's birthday. I need the rest of you to do the same ASAP. I'll leave the keys in the break room. 

Thanks guys,

Kenny
===========ID 0x00003A6B: Greg,

Did you see Kenny's memo? The boss is coming out here, and we have to hide all the "party supplies". I'll take care of everything in our room, you get the stuff from your locker.

Keys for the container are in the breakroom. Or they were, before Austin stashed his stuff. You know how he is. 

Get this done QUICK. Kenny's been driving me crazy about it all day.

===========ID 0x00003A8B: When I think of the creature's transformation, I think of the eel.

The eel is an old Earth fish, from the order Anguilliformes. They were curious creatures, who flummoxed fishermen and scientists alike due to their lack of reproductive organs. Their mere existence begged the question, where did the eel come from? How did it mate?

Some believed they were creatures born of mud and water. Folklore had them rising from the ocean foam, or manifested from the fallen hair of a mermaid. 

The confusion arose because the eel was not always the eel they knew. It went through stages of metamorphosis, taking different forms over the course of its life before maturing into its final form. It's only in this final stage, when its stomach dissolves and it's forced to survive on its own fat, that the eel finally develops its reproductive organs. No reproductive organs, because they had not yet taken shape.

Which brings me back to this creature, resting in its cocoon. We have observed it on land, and in our facilities. But were we merely blind to its full life cycle? Can we be certain that what we are witnessing is not simply nature taking its course? 

If this creature is moving toward a reproductive phase, then the spores could be a sedative, designed to docile any nearby predators and prey.

What worries me more is this could be just the beginning. The clutch size of an eel is anywhere from 500,000 to 4,000,000 eggs. No doubt, there will be mouths to feed.

All expenses are paid and you have a 3000 credit a day per diem. Thursday night there is a dinner for all the speakers, if you would like to attend please RSVP now. It is formal and we'd be thrilled if you join us.

===========ID 0x00003AEC: Mr. Sobakin,
Sorry to contact you out of the blue, but I have an exciting prospect for you. I am a senior recruiter at Stroud-Eklund Staryard and we've been eyeing you and your career for some time. Although Ms. Ulbrecht is a household name among Starship Engineers - few realize how important a role you've played at Taiyo. Would you be interested in grabbing dinner some time so I could talk to you about Stroud-Eklund? We're growing and we want to spin up a new research group and we need a new team leader. We're hoping that's you.

So contact me any time, and let's talk!

Jun Carter
Stroud-Eklund Staryard, Sr. Recruiter
===========ID 0x00003AEE: So we have the new model of the Dolphin coming up - one of our best sellers. Last model year we had a line of 100 people camped out for a week. Neon Security has said this is unacceptable and they will "take steps" if we don't solve this.

So the challenge for our office is: how do we preserve and encourage consumer excitement while obeying Administrator Bayu's order? This is where you come in. There is one-time performance bonus for the winning idea on how to solve this. Get your ideas in by Friday!
===========ID 0x00003AEF: [Test Text Do Not Use] Peak Performance: Get the most out of you.
===========ID 0x00003AF2: [Test Text Do Not Use] Peak Performance: Get the most out of you.

===========ID 0x00003AF7: [Test Text Do Not Use] Peak Performance: Get the most out of you.
===========ID 0x00003AFB: Make sure to take care of this one. Can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going to miss it.

It's recently has had some malfunctioning, but it's been my trusty henchman. The best among "the BOT-any'! (Do not use this on any official documentation) 

Maybe one of your first tasks could be to get it up and running. Trust me, you'll appreciate its company during your stay. 
===========ID 0x00003AFC: I would double check and adjust the temperature every three hours. These plants are most sensitive to light and temperature. They were always my problem children, so just be careful with them. 

Also, the door is locked via the control room. I try to not let the robots gain access since these plants need more delicate care. They mean well, but none of them have a particularly green thumb.
===========ID 0x00003B00: Here's the coords to the stash Benny and I hid a couple raids back. Once you get there, check up on the rocks above the entrance. Can't miss it.

===========ID 0x00003B02: I keep fielding questions about some of the new processes, and I understand that change is frightening. But the idea is to remove all the pain points with buying a ship. Yes, we will open ourselves up to higher rates of fraud and contract defaults - but that is okay. If you go to any other Staryards it takes hours for our major clients to walk away with a signed contract. Sometimes it takes days. It's painful, it's antagonistic, and it's outdated.

Every aspect of Stroud-Eklund Staryards has to be customer first. If we live and breathe by that code, any losses we accrue will be made up with word of mouth business and happy, loyal customers. So every decision you make, ask yourself: have I made the customer's lives better? If the answer is "no" then go back to the drawing board.

We are reinventing the business of Staryards, and I am proud to be on this journey with all of you.
===========ID 0x00003B05: Can you believe it's been 10 years since Catimine Hills? I went to the cemetery and put flowers on Dante's grave. We lost so many, and do they remember? It barely made the news when it happened.

I know you claim you're happy with Deimos, but our unit can really use you. Mercenary work may be tough on your code, but the pay and benefits are better than anything Deimos can offer. And after doing it for years, I firmly believe that the UC and Freestar are both self-interested puppets for rich interests. It's never been about the grunt, the pilots, or the common Joe. That's just lies they tell to get fools to keep dying to help their bottom lines.

Please, it's almost like the old unit's back together. We're your real family, and we miss our XO. At least reply this time.
===========ID 0x00003B08: I followed up on your testimonials and I must say they were impressive. And persuasive. Although your penchant for "frankness" has been on your last three reviews... Well, I'm going to follow up with Sales and Marketing. It may be an uphill battle - but your point that the on-the-ground engineers can smell... dishonesty... may be correct. Certainly our up-sells and acquisition rate has climbed significantly since you joined us.

For now, try to reign it in a little? I promise I'll get a definitive answer before the next review cycle commences. But don't worry about job security, you are an integral part of Deimos.

My Mech is fine, just some minor arm damage, but I've got to get out of here. I'm making a run for it the second I get a chance. If anyone reads this... I'm sorry.

I know you were upset that I left the Constant. It wasn't an easy decision for me either, but you know I was unhappy there, drifting aimlessly forever. I hope you understand why I had to go, just as I understand why you had to stay.

Things are going very well for me here in New Atlantis. I have a job working the front desk at a small accounting business while I take classes. I'm not sure what I'm working towards yet, but I'm thinking of either majoring in Earth History, or Media Production so I can work in film. I know, big difference, but you know I've always been jealous of your job aboard the Constant, and now I can pursue something like that on my own!

I've also been seeing someone I met after striking up a conversation while getting lunch one day. Their name is Bodhi, and so far, things are going well with them.

Anyway, I hope this letter finds you soon. Maybe I can come visit next time I hear of the Constant's whereabouts?

Love,

I know the last few years have been tough. I know you think we should just hide away from the world, but I can't do that.

We lost so many good people, and the monsters that are responsible are still out there. Their fake serpent god won't punish them for what they did, but someone has to. So it's going to be me.

I've joined the UC Vanguard. I know you'd tell me that's risky, what with our past, but it turns out it's not a problem. Remember how we used to joke about the Den being so lax about patrolling? Turns out that works for their background checks, too. And now, when I find those Zealots, I'll have the UC backing me up. 

They're not getting away. Once I've got my hands on them, we can find out if they've heard of this "Tomisar Ka'dic" you mentioned.

I'll send word when it's over.

===========ID 0x00003BB6: I tried to convince him, I tried to stop him - but he wouldn't hear of it.  He went on and on about how this was destiny, how science was a supernatural calling.  He was crazed when he plugged himself into that thing and now he's dead and we're adrift.  I hope he's out there among the stars, looking down - I hope this was worth it but I'll never know.
===========ID 0x00003BB9: I've been convinced for years that it's possible to create a link between a human mind and a grav drive... There are so many unknowns to this technology, but my scans show a polymorphic system that mimics human cognition.  Earl is convinced that this will kill me and the ship but the price is worth it in my mind.

===========ID 0x00003C07: The final epic conclusion of the Dragonstar Force Saga! Barton Spinner, son of Martin Spinner, returns to finish the epic conclusion to the saga his father began writing thirty years ago! In order to defeat the Dragonstar itself, the Dragonstar Force must assemble the legendary Lazerlance and vanquish every last dragon in the known universe. Only then, can they infuse it with their souls, ridding the universe of dragons and magic alike, but will peace be worth the sacrifices made? The last Dragonstar Force adventure awaits!
===========ID 0x00003C09: The Dragonstar awakens! Having vanquished Sarklonn for the last time, the Dragonstar Force discovers that Shussalina had merely been controlled by her father's will from beyond the grave. Their newfound alliance has only made the Dragonstar Force stronger than ever before. The mysterious Montelvaughn returns, gravely injured, and with his dying breath, portends a dire prophecy: the Dragonstar itself has gained sentience, and will wage war against transdimensional existence! As the Force prepares, the Dragonstar begins its machinations.
===========ID 0x00003C0B: Sarrklon returns again! Using the power of Dragonstar, Shussalina manages to resurrect her father, Sarrklon. But her reunion does not go as planned. The necromantic magic warped his mind and twisted his soul, while giving him newfound power. Unable to contain her father, Shussalina flees to the frozen world of Helixaia at the edge of the known universe. Tanskler, Glorp, and Minnialissa must track her down to undo the spell put and end to Sarrklon once and for all.
===========ID 0x00003C0C: Unlikely alliances! Having failed her plans for revenge thus far, Shussalina goes into exile, and the universe is seemingly at peace once again. However, a strange new alien race, the Glotzians, appear. Surrounding the Galactic Council's homeworld, they demand immediate surrender. Tanskler and the New Dragonstar Force race to its rescue, but find their new Glotzian foes too much to handle. During their retreat, the Dragonstar Force rescues an old drifter, who turns out to be the mysterious Montelvaughn. He brings them to the far reaches of space, where they meet Grimmtongue the Nebula Wyrm, the most ancient of all dragons, who promises to help, for a price.
===========ID 0x00003C0F: Dragons within! Shussalina, the forgotten daughter of Sarrklon, has assembled the fractured Dragonstar and seeks her revenge! Using the magic of Dragonstar, she covertly travels to the peaceful world of Ploximar, bringing with her a seemingly magical pox, infecting the local populace. What seemed to be a disease turns out to be millions of microdragons, shrunken down to microscopic scale by the power of the reformed Dragonstar. Unbeknownst to her, Tanskler and his new friends Glorp, the gelatinous golem, and Minnialissa, the fae witchling, are on a diplomatic mission to Ploximar when Tanskler falls ill to the dragon pox. His companions shrink down and enter his body to take on the microscopic threat.
===========ID 0x00003C10: The all-new Dragonstar Force! Twenty years have passed, and Tanskler has grown, proving himself a hero when he stops a goblin uprising on the prison planet Porbulis VII. But unbeknownst to him, a great evil escapes from the planet: Sarrklon's daughter, a tortured soul, too dark even for the likes of her father. Seeking revenge for her imprisonment, she begins her plan to reform the Dragonstar. Can Tanskler, along with friends both old and new, find the missing shards of the Dragonstar before it's too late?
===========ID 0x00003C13: Son of Zeffrex! Having vanquished the horrible Elder Wishdragon by sacrificing her ability to bring Zeffrex back from the dead, Princess Laglorial finally retires from the Dragonstar Force.  But when a freak timestorm ages her son, Tanskler, into an adult, she finds herself in a mess she can't handle by herself. As Tanskler  conducts a reign of terror, she finds she must call on the aid of her former companions, Jarmon and Protonius to reverse the effects of the time storm and figure out how to prevent Tanskler's future from becoming reality.
===========ID 0x00003C14: The death of Zeffrex! Having sacrificed himself to merge with the Ultra Dragonstar and defeat the Specter of Sarrklon once and for all, the mighty Zeffrex Laserbrand is no more. While mourning the loss of her husband, Princess Laglorial happens upon a fabled wishstone. However, the chaotic power of the wishstone makes things much worse before they are better. And in the end, can Laglorial make the right choice between reviving her dead lover, or saving the universe once again?
===========ID 0x00003C17: A universe at peace! All seems well for the Dragonstar Force. Jeffrex Laserbrand, having successfully restored the natural balance of the universe, has settled in with Princess Laglorial on her homeworld of Zlaxx. When vacationing offworld with their newborn son, a massive explosion rends their homeworld apart. The Dragonstar Force reconvenes to avenge the planet's sudden destruction, but what they find, haunts them. The latent power of the Ultra Dragonstar manifests as a Phantom Dragon, merged with the life force of Sarrklon, and it seeks revenge on the Dragonstar Force. Can they defeat an enemy they can't see?
===========ID 0x00003C18: The climax of the Reality Saga! After performing the Universal Reset, Jeffrex Laserbrand must relive the past in order to put reality back in its rightful place. Revisiting old friends and past enemies alike, Jeffrex reforms powerful alliances and must be careful not to ignite past conflicts without endangering his life's successes. Montelvaughn appears in his hour of need, but is the price he demands too high for a conflicted Jeffrex? Is it possible to reform his life without invoking the looming Specter of Sarrklon?
===========ID 0x00003C1B: A battle for space and time! Montelvaughn returns with grave news. The shards of the Ultra Dragonstar have played havoc with time and space. After explaining that the Galactic Triumvirate was merely a figment of reality, the Dragonstar Force questions what is real and what is not. In order to save the future, they must piece together the past and unravel the fabric of reality itself! But in doing so, they may negate some of their past heroic actions. Will it be worth it, to once again save all they hold dear?
===========ID 0x00003C1D: The end of the Dragonstar Force? After the dimensional mishaps of their last adventure, and the universe finally at peace, the Galactic Triumvirate decides to abolish the Dragonstar Force for good. As Jeffrex and Laglorial adjust to domestic life, Jarmon and Protonius seek answers. But, they soon regret what they discover. The Galactic Triumvirate may not be what they seem!
===========ID 0x00003C1E: Death of Sarrklon? Armed with the knowledge to bend dimensions to his whim, Sarrklon enacts his plans to bring together Dragonstars from all dimensions to form the Ultra Dragonstar. The Dragonstar Force must band together with heroic versions of themselves from across the planes and form an army capable of defeating Sarrklon once and for all. But can they defeat his army of transdimensional dragons, empowered by the combined might of the Ultra Dragonstar?
===========ID 0x00003C20: Mind over matter! Having escaped from the Grommulon dimension with the intact Dragonstar, the Dragonstar Force now finds themselves trapped in prisons of their own minds. It turns out that merging with evil alternate-dimension versions of themselves has caused more problems than it may have solved. Now, our heroes fight for their very souls and must battle their own personal demons if they wish to survive!
===========ID 0x00003C23: A confluence of heroes! Having accepted defeat at the hands of their evil selves, our heroes await a grim death sentence in the dungeons of Jarmlek. Meanwhile, the Grommulon version of Sarrklon discovers a way to bend the dimensions to his will using the merged Dragonstars and formulates a plan to save the Dragonstar Force. But, it will take merging with himself from the prime dimension. Can his fractured psyche survive such a quantum entanglement, and will he manage to save our intrepid heroes?
===========ID 0x00003C25: Stuck in the Grommulon dimension! After getting stuck inside the Grommulon dimension, the mighty Jeffrex and his companions seek a way out. However, they run afoul of evil versions of themselves, and the only soul willing to aid them in their fight against the evil Dragonstar Force and their Nega-Dragons is a weak, but highly knowledgeable version of Sarrklon! Can they trust this Sarrklon, or will they be repeating past mistakes?
===========ID 0x00003C27: A new threat? With the Dragonstar firmly in their possession, Jeffrex and the Dragonstar force decide to hide it away once and for all, in the safest place they can find: the Grommulon black hole. But soon after disposing of the Dragonstar, they begin to hear voices emanating from the black hole, including that of Jeffrex's lost brother, Halke. Venturing beyond the event horizon, our heroes discover dark mysteries that threaten not only this universe, but all dimensions as well!
===========ID 0x00003C29: Back in time! With the universe in ruins, Laglorial finds herself the last living member of the Dragonstar force. After managing to rebuild Protonius out of scrap pieces herself, the android reveals the secret to traveling through time, and the two decide to venture back before the Last War, which nearly wiped out all of existence. Will our heroes manage to stop the Dragonstar from being destroyed this time and save reality as we know it?
===========ID 0x00003C2B: The end of the universe? Sarrklon, now lord of the galaxy, unexpectedly shows up at the door to the Dragonstar Force's secret hideout. But, as it turns out, he comes seeking their help, not their destruction. When the Dragonstar suddenly vanishes, Sarklonn fears that an even greater power is at work, and it not only threatens his rule, but also all of existence! Will the heroes trust their nemesis and take advantage of his vast resources, or strike out on their own?
===========ID 0x00003C2C: The end of the Force? When it is revealed that Princess Laglrorial is seemingly working for Sarrklon, our heroes part ways. After mourning the loss of his wife to side of his most hated nemesis, Jeffrex gets a visit from an old friend. The mysterious Montelvaughn returns to dispense wisdom and help solve the mystery behind Laglorial's sudden betrayal, but is it merely a ploy to get a hold of the fabled Dragonstar?
===========ID 0x00003C2F: Desperate times, desperate measures! When Sarklonn reveals his plan to destroy all the dragons in the galaxy with the Dragonstar, Jeffrex Laserbrand and the rest of the Dragonstar Force must form an uneasy alliance with their former Dragon foes, the dragonspawn of Fraxitarr! The dragons arm Jeffrex with a new weapon of their own creation, the laser-axe, Glorybringer, in hopes he can use it to bring Sarrklon's reign to an end.
===========ID 0x00003C31: Sarrklon is back, for real this time! Jeffrex and princess Laglorial's wedding is cut short by the return of their old nemesis, Sarrklon. Having revealed himself to be a changeling himself, our heroes question who it was they defeated before. Was it a clone, a robot double, or a mind-controlled changeling minion? But solving that mystery will have to wait, as Sarrklon steals the Dragonstar, once again sending the Dragonstar Force on the hunt for the galaxy's greatest power.
===========ID 0x00003C32: Imposters in their midst! The mystery of Sarrklon's reappearance may not be resolved, but our heroes have a new problem to deal with: their companions may not be who they say they are. After visiting a resort planet, Jarmon begins acting strangely, even for a changeling! They discover that Jarmon is in fact an imposter in disguise, sowing the seeds of doubt among the entire Dragonstar Force. Who is who, and can anyone be trusted again?
===========ID 0x00003C35: Sarklonn has returned? Our heroes are shaken when a strange, haunting signal is picked up by the Dragonstar Force's ship. It appears Sarrklon was not as defeated as they had thought! But is it true, or is it all an elaborate ruse? Our heroes rush to get to the bottom of this mystery.
===========ID 0x00003C36: The thrilling conclusion to the Dragonstar Force Saga! Jeffrex Laserbrand's trusty android companion, Protonius, discovers the hidden  location of the Dragonstar, in the heart of a gigantic gaseous planet protected by a swarm of Gas Giant Dragons! In order to retrieve it, they'll need the help of a reluctant dwarven ship smith, Klauslinger. Will our heroes reach the Dragonstar in time to stop Sarrklon?
===========ID 0x00003C38: The Dragons have returned! Fraxitarr may be defeated, but Zeffrex discovers a clutch of hatched eggs, and surely enough, reports of dragons attacking starships have been running rampant! but is Zeffrex to blame for the release of the dragons, or has he been set up? As Laglorial and Jarmon race to get to the bottom of the mystery and clear the good name of Jeffrex Laserbrand, Sarrklon redoubles his effort in search for the Dragonstar.
===========ID 0x00003C3B: The epic saga continues! The mysterious Montelvaugh disappears, but not before divulging the location of the fabled Dragonstar. But, when Zeffrex journeys alone to extract it from its hiding place, he finds it missing! to make matters worse, he accidentally unleashes the dreaded Space Dragon, Fraxitarr from her crystal prison! Our heroes must reunite to take down this new threat before all is lost!
===========ID 0x00003C3D: A tale of woe and revenge! After torturing  Zeffrex Laserbrand's brother, and ruthlessly killing him by sending him into a black hole, Sarrklon is led directly to our heroes' hideout. Now, held captive beneath the surface of the water planet, Harglys V, things look grim for the Dragonstar Force! Will they escape with the help of their new friend, Montelvaughn, or will he turn against them in their time of need?
===========ID 0x00003C3E: The hunt for the Dragonstar continues! Zeffrex and his heroic companions, Protonius the android, Lagloriel the Princess of Zlaxx, and Jarmon the Changeling may have escaped from the clutches of Sarrklon and destroyed his asteroid fortress, but the galaxy is still in peril. With Sarrklon now in pursuit of the Dragonstar himself, it's a race for who will control the fate of the universe!
===========ID 0x00003C40: The universe is in chaos! The evil Sarrklon, an alien being born of pure hatred, has amassed his secret armies to rain destruction upon the people of the Allied Worlds. A young man, Zeffrex Laserbrand, is thrust into the conflict when he discovers he is the descendent of a great hero, and one of the only ones capable of wielding the Dragonstar, a magical weapon capable of defeating Sarrklon and bringing peace to the galaxy. But first, it must be found.
===========ID 0x00003C42: <b>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MATURATION OF OCCISIO MACHINA</b>
ABSTRACT

The Occisio Machina species is primarily known for two things - it's unparalleled brutality and its strange maturation patterns. Luckily for humanity, the latter has prevented the former from being a cause for major concern.

Until today.

Tunneling = failed
Tampering with robots = almost wiped us all out

Fail fail fail. There must be a way.
===========ID 0x00003C46: Africa calls to me. In my dreams I see it's burnt seared skies. The dunes, the scrub tundra, all of the wildlife the Gods chose to bless us with.

I see its people. Strong, powerful, a hard people as we must be in our tough land. To hear what became of so many after my time... pierces my heart.

Would that we had left the Cradle of Humanity and marched on the Eternal City and humbled her. Imagine what histories would be told with us as the heroes?

But it is something to know that I am here when so many others aren't. Who is laughing now, Augustus?
===========ID 0x00003C49: Sometimes when Amanirenas tells stories of her wars against the Romans... Is she really reincarnated? I mean, the details - just how much emotion she expresses. When I came to the Believers it's because I think the Mission is right. I may not know who I am (maybe one of the Chinese Emperors? That just feels right? Wouldn't it be wild if I was Sun Tzu?) but I just know in my bones that the worlds outside are in a terrible state.

Whoever built all of this, they had a good reason. But after being with Amanirenas so long, it's hard not to get swept away in it. Are we the tip of the spear of a real Golden Age?
===========ID 0x00003C4A: Last week we had a major spike and all power went out. It lasted for two hours. People came outside, and the Societies mingled and joked like it was a holiday.

I wanted to shout - what about the Charions? Everyone wanders around blissfully unconcerned that there are dangerous predators literally everywhere on this  planet. The only thing that keeps them away are the turrets and sound mechanisms (not sure what to call them) on the wall.

We are so utterly dependent on the Facility. The only reason I'm here is because Franklin's the only one that seems to give a damn.
===========ID 0x00003C4D: I was married to Clarinda in my previous incarnation. Everyone says we were such a cute couple and expects us to get back together. But she's a complete stranger and she's so... old. It's been so very, very awkward. 

She keeps looking at me deeply/romantically. She calls me "dearest" all the time. My friends ask if I'm bringing Clarinda with me, because they're just used to that. It's driving me a little crazy.

As much as I believe in Franklin and the Pragmatist philosophy... I'm seriously considering leaving just to get some distance from her.
===========ID 0x00003C4E: Chapter 3, Mining Suit Maintenance

Of all the hazards that exist out there in space, you'll find yourself easily forgetting about CO2 buildup in your respirator. That's a huge mistake. Even a small amount of CO2 is going to add up over the course of your day, sapping just a little bit of life out of you when you need it. Running is harder, swinging that cutter around takes one more huff than you want, and when a tunnel collapses you want to be moving as fast and across as long a distance as possible. Invest in a good helmet, trust me.

===========ID 0x00003C68: Ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon in 1969, humanity has been obsessed with the idea of permanently breaking free from the confines of Earth's gravity. Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.

But in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA's mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.

And then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity's greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity's ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.

Of course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth's planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050.
===========ID 0x00003C69: <font size='30'><b>PROJECT ANALYSIS</font>

This time will be different. It won't be about me, so I won't have to run. I can actually build something with intent instead of scrambling to fix something that others create in my name. It can be something beneficial. I can be something beneficial.

I'm leaving behind that other person. This world has no place for him. Let him die. Let me live to enlighten the blessed universe before me.

Aleksy, you always made sure I didn't feel like a dumbass whenever I screwed up. You'd have a story about the time you crashed the ship, or spilled beer on the pilot's console and... oh right! That was a secret! Sorry Captain, that's why the controls are sticky. My bad Aleksy.

===========ID 0x00003CD1: Sometimes hauling cargo is like those puzzles you play as a kid. You have to put the pieces in a precise order or else it won't fit. 

This is because in our line of work, crate dimensions don't adhere to any particular standard, or use the same system of measurement. 4 x 8 feet crates will often need to be stacked alongside 3 x 6 meter boxes. Then there's the type of crate. You got fragile goods, dry bulk, wet bulk, etcetera. 

But it's important we be precise. If security does an inspection, they'll see our crates are professionally organized. That goes a long way to looking legitimate.

So when I found the cargo hold a mess after takeoff, I didn't know how to explain it. Maybe it was the condensation on the floors, or crates tumbling over when we hit escape velocity for Moloch I. 

But last night lying in my bed, I heard noises coming from the hold. And I started to wonder if there isn't another explanation that fits.

===========ID 0x00003CD3: We land on Moloch I and it's just arid, rocky desert. Mile after mile of brown. But the Captain checks the coordinates and says the cargo's about twenty paces ahead, at the base of a pillar.

We walk toward it, and sure enough, there's a pile of crates just sitting there in the middle of nowhere. Lottie's confident she can get everything to fit, but I don't know. What exactly is in these things? Who left them here?

I've got questions, and the Captain ain't got any answers. All she can think about is the creds. After what we paid for the shields, can't say I blame her.

But maybe I'll head down to the cargo hold, and take a peek inside before we grav jump to Vectera. Given all this secrecy, I figure the information might be worth something to somebody.
===========ID 0x00003CD5: These crates we picked up from Moloch I weigh more than a bloody spacetruck. I tell the Quartermaster I think I cracked my dirty brain pushing them and he tells me it's called a "vertebrae," even though I know for a fact he just made that word up. 

Anyway, we're pushing an especially large crate up the ramp, and I call timeout, because I need a break. So I lean back against it and wipe my brow, when suddenly, the crate pushes back. I swear on me mother, the bloody thing SHOOK.

Meanwhile the Quartermaster's pissed because I'm backing away and the crate's sliding back down the ramp. He's calling me a lazy oaf and all manner of childish insults. When I tell him the crate's got something innit, he says "Of course it gots something in it. What do you think we're smuggling, air?" and kicks the thing. I tell him, he shouldn't do that. But he don't listen.
 

===========ID 0x00003CD7: I've always had trouble making new friends. In school they used to call me "Qwerty," because I needed a computer to express myself. And when I did talk, I'd say something awkward, and people would laugh. 

People think the only time I'm funny is when I don't mean to be.

Well, I disagree! It's not that I don't have a sense of humor, I'm just not used to using my outside voice! I get anxious in big crowds and just clam up. 

So I've been trying to practice by talking to one of the Model As on board, who I've affectionately named Qwerty. Why? Because robots are funny even when they don't mean to be, just like me.

But ever since the Spacer attack, I feel like something's changed. I can't quite put my finger on why, but it's like every robot on this ship is stuck in combat mode, and they're constantly on alert. Qwerty won't talk to me about casual things, and what's worse, he'll sometimes forget my name.

I talked to May about it and she said I shouldn't worry. Robots do 3D facial scanning, vocal recognition, and full body biometric data scanning, and cross-reference it with the crew database. I joked that maybe Qwerty should buy me a drink first, and May laughed!

I was so happy that I made a joke in person, I ran to Qwerty to tell him the news. But he didn't even care, he just wanted to patrol the deck. Something's still off.
===========ID 0x00003CD9: For the love of god, what is the deal with these freaking robots? 

I get that everyone loves them for what they did to those Spacers, but I got to be honest, they've gone from saving our asses to being big fat pain in the asses.

All I want is to go to the kitchen and make myself a sandwich, and I got this machine breathing exhaust in my face, asking if I have permission to leave my quarters. 

I got your permission right here, circuit brain. And if you try to boss me around again, I'll slam it right through your glass eye.
===========ID 0x00003CDB: Ever since that dust up with Spacers near Bessel II the robots on this ship have been acting strangely. I've chided the Captain in the past about not running periodic OS checks but we've recently completed a firmware update so I don't think it's that.

Several of the crew members are claiming the robots will on occasion deny them access to the bunks, kitchen, and cockpit, asking them if they have clearance. I've noted that we're dealing with decommissioned UC Navy models, and some sort of remnant programming could be rearing its ugly head.

The start of the errant behavior coincides with the Spacer attack, in which the robots fought admirably. The timing of it can't be ignored.
===========ID 0x00003CDF: It's been a crazy 24 hours and I'm exhausted. Trident short-staffed the flight so that left three of us who had to stay up all night to set up the Starview Ballroom. Place looks amazing, but I doubt the snobby "TPS" passengers will even notice. Anyone that has enough money to ride on the Siren certainly isn't going to care about the effort we put in to keep them comfortable. Really ticks me off how those rich folk just expect all of it to happen.

Maybe it's time I took Havertino up on his offer to transfer to Trident's Cargo Division. Honest work and no one thumbing their nose up at me? Sounds tempting.
===========ID 0x00003CE3: Daddy,

This is an absolute disaster. You never told me that I'd only be able to take one valet on this cruise. Imagine how it felt when I had to send the other three home at the Siren's departure station! You won't believe it but I actually had to CARRY MY OWN BAG. Can you imagine the humiliation? 

Oh well, at least the food on board is halfway decent. The wine, however? Disgusting. I think Trident neglected to hire a proper sommelier. Thank goodness I brought a few bottles from our cellars.

Anyway, that's all for now. I guess I'll see you when this horror show is over. 

As always, your loving son, Hannibal.

Okay, now how the hell do you... how do you send this? Hello? Isn't this voice activated? No, you stupid thing, stop printing what I'm... *unintelligible*... this is preposterous. Send! Send! No, send! You stupid piece of junk. Wait until my father hears about this.
===========ID 0x00003CE4: Captain: All right, let's see how this baby works.

Nichols: Awesome, are we gonna test out that new turret system? I volunteer Josef as a target dummy.

Josefsson: Very funny, Nichols. You do realize a direct hit from a rubber projectile still, as you say... hurts like hell?

Nichols: That's what I'm counting on buddy.

Captain: Okay, okay, enough with the clown show. You do realize all this is on the record Nichols? Admissible in a court of law?

Nichols: Well, someone has to be the target.

Captain: Good point. EARS, update target settings. Remove combat inhibitors. Protect current user.

Josefsson: Oh no...

Nichols: You low down, dirty...

Josefsson: Eyaaaaagh! That stings!
===========ID 0x00003CE6: Captain: Nichols, don't play around with the registry. Put your name in there properly.

Nichols: What's wrong? You don't like saying "EARS, protect the King?"

EARS: Protecting user, LaMarr Nichols.

Captain: Sigh. You can have your joke names in there, but for the love of god, please put Nichols and LaMarr in there too. 

Nichols: Fine, fine. I'll add my government name. But only because you said the magic word.

Josefsson: The vocal recognition seems to work though. Looking at the current targeting subroutines, Nichols' protection is listed as a priority. 

Nichols: Hell yeah, as it should be.
===========ID 0x00003CE9: To use EARS, your voice must be registered at the main network terminal with a specific name. Repeat your name five times, as well as all names in the registry, so that they can be accurately recorded. 

Once you are registered, you can utilize the following commands, using AND to issue multiple directives:

EARS, protect (name).

EARS, protect (name) and (name).

EARS, activate turret (number).

EARS, activate all.

EARS, deactivate turret (number).

EARS, deactivate all.

EARS, remove combat inhibitors.
===========ID 0x00003CEB: With the turret system in place, taking out the crew will be simple. I'll just need to prep the system with two commands:

EARS, activate all and remove combat inhibitors.

EARS, protect Micke Josefsson.

Once the turrets are active and the crew is dead, I can safely deliver the prototype to my contacts at DRONE. I've been told the price for this tech could be quite lucrative.

===========ID 0x00003CEC: Goddamnit. The voice registry is bugged, and isn't recognizing any of the secondary names for the crew. Edits are also broken.

Which means the joke names Nichols entered as PRIMARY into the system are going to be what we use to identify individual users. Thankfully the global functions look like they work, and I've set the current crew to be protected. It'll only be a problem if someone removes the combat inhibitors and we need to redo protections in the heat of battle.

Testing these prototypes is always a hassle. I need to ask for more creds next time.
===========ID 0x00003CEF: The Captain did not like the fact I filled up the registry with uh... less than flattering nicknames. But seriously though, how was I supposed to know that thing was bugged beyond repair?

Bottom line, I'm just trying to inject a little levity into the job. Everyone here can be so DOWN, all the time, and there's no reason for it. 

We got the best job in the world, trying out new tech in the void of space, surrounded by the greatest light show in the galaxy. I need to remind folks of that. Especially my man Josef. Everything dude touches turns into a funeral, and we can't have that, not on my watch.

I just gotta figure out a way to make my guy smile.

===========ID 0x00003CF0: It's so hot.

I feel like I'm cooking.

Burning up, inside and out.

We're almost out of water. 

I don't know whether to drink it, or pour it on my head.
===========ID 0x00003CF3: I wish the Captain had taken Dr. Suruki's advice. I wish we all had.

I don't care about the mission any more. I understand we swore an oath, and that this rift is bigger than the lives of this crew.

But I have a husband and daughter at home. Right now, they're all that matter to me, and I would do anything to see them again.
===========ID 0x00003CF6: Heard you're looking for work, and I owe you for the Porrima job.

So here's me, making us even. On your travels, keep an eye out for a hideout called Vulture's Roost.

It's run by Ecliptic, and home to the largest collection of mercs, lowlifes, and hired guns in the Settled Systems. They got bunks for sleep, and booze to drink. And to top it all off, just about every piece of contraband you ever wished you could steal. 

But they don't take kindly to strangers, so if you're still flying that Taiyo rustbucket with the broken landing gear, I'll let 'em know you'll be limping into port. 

Otherwise, prepare to be shot at. Nothing personal, them's the rules.
===========ID 0x00003CF9: My life is over. It's really starting to settle in now - I'm a dead man walking. If Zeek doesn't kill me, the Red Mile will. 

How did I get into this mess? I never should have taken his money. Everyone warned me about him, too, but of course I didn't listen. I never do, and I guess I won't be alive long enough to learn how to.  

He seemed like a nice guy at first. Gave me all the money I needed to get by. I was really struggling at the time and he was the only one that would help me out. I should've known better. Like mom always told me - everyone wants something, but no one wants to give.  

Zeek is actually the one who put me up to this. Says if I can't pay the interest on his loans, I should give this a shot. "What's the harm?" he said. What an asshole. 

I'm not sure what his endgame is. If I'm dead, I can't ever pay him back. Maybe he's had enough of me and just wants to kill me off, but he doesn't wanna do the dirty work himself. Yeah, sounds like him. 

Well, I'm dead either way. Might as well try and accept it. 


===========ID 0x00003CFA: In just a few days, I'm gonna be filthy rich.

Ah man, the look on my friends' faces when I told them I'll be running the Red Mile was priceless. They kept saying "Are you stupid? You're gonna get yourself killed!" or "This is a terrible idea." I couldn't stop laughing. 

I mean, yeah, I don't think any of them would survive the course. They're too doughy, too slow, and can't shoot to save their lives. But me? I'm different. I can run a 14-minute mile without breaking a sweat. I've even gone camping more times than I can count. 

They're just too embarrassed to admit that I've got what it takes, but they don't, and never will. It's actually kind of insulting that they think I won't survive, but I'll show them. And then, when I'm done gloating, I'll do it all again!  
===========ID 0x00003CFD: Sylvia,

I hope you will never read this, because if you have, there's a good chance that I'm dead.  

I decided to run the Red Mile a few weeks ago. Please understand - I wanted to tell you, but I knew you would convince me not to run the course. The bills just kept piling up, and no amount of money we made seemed to be enough. At least this way I could try to provide for you and the kids like I always should have.

As I write this, I know it's a terrible idea. I hope that I'll be able to delete this message, and that we can start a new life with the money I make. But if not, just know that I love you and that I'm sorry. I should've told you and I shouldn't have done this.   


===========ID 0x00003CFF: I've heard great things about Red Mile. Apparently the creatures there are so vicious they can rip you to shreds in seconds. Sounds like a great time to me. 

Screw the credits, I just want a chance to go toe-to-claw with these monsters. My trigger finger is itching just thinking about it. Time for the hunters to become the hunted!


===========ID 0x00003D00: Don't want to jinx anything, but screw it - I've found the motherlode. 

This makes it all worth it. The sleepless nights, the isolation, the backbreaking labor, the countless failures. None of that matters now. All I can think about is digging deeper.

Just a few more feet and I'll be richer than I've ever thought possible. My whole life has been leading to this moment! 
===========ID 0x00003D02: I know you've got your own messes to deal with, but I just wanted to let you know. The Crimson Fleet hit our facility and we're completely out of supplies. 

We're heading back home for now, and taking some time off. Just didn't want you to be blindsided when you got back.  

Your partner
===========ID 0x00003D04: So far, yield has been stellar. The veins we are tapping continue to produce impressive quantities of nickel and aluminum, as well as other ores.

What's better is that the well shows no signs of drying up. Yield has only increased the deeper we dig. 
===========ID 0x00003D09: Thomas,

It is with great sadness that I must inform you of your wife's passing. While tapping a particularly fruitful vein, a seismic event occurred that collapsed the area of the mine your wife and many others were working in. She died instantly and was in no pain.

She was a great worker, and we all will miss her dearly. We are continuing the dig in her and the others' honor. 

I am keeping you in my thoughts during this difficult time.

Best,

Foreman Noel Schulman
===========ID 0x00003D0B: The foreman and geologist say that we're continuing the dig. They say it's the best way to honor those lost in the collapse. 

What a load of crap. If they actually cared about them we would be packing up right now and calling it quits. Hell, I might just do that myself - I don't wanna die in this hellhole.  
===========ID 0x00003D0D: I don't hear anything anymore. It's so quiet.

It's almost like we're in the middle of a grav jump.

Everything is so... tranquil. 

I'm at peace.
===========ID 0x00003D0F: We're running out of time and ideas.

I need to think of something, but who can think when everything is crumbling around us?

Think stupid, think. What would the Captain do in a situation like this?
===========ID 0x00003D11: <p align='center'>I am not afraid

I am not afraid

I am not afraid</p>

===========ID 0x00003D12: Things are starting to look pretty grim.

If we don't make it out alive, I just want to tell my spouse I love them.

And if I ever see them again, I'll never take that time for granted. I promise.
===========ID 0x00003D14: This is hopeless. The rest of the crew thinks we can survive this, but there's no way.

So excuse me if I don't want to spend my last hours in a full panic.

I just want to kick back and walk into the light with my head held high. Some Aurora would be nice too.
===========ID 0x00003D17: I don't know if we'll make it out of this alive.

I just want one last bite of Chunks. Big chunks. Little chunks.

And then I'll wash it down with some Terraccino.

Oh man, that sounds like heaven.
===========ID 0x00003D19: If this is my last flight, what a ride it's been.

I've seen everything a human can see in one lifetime.

And while the universe has plenty more to offer, it'll have to wait for the next turn.
===========ID 0x00003D1A: I snuck onto this ship and now it's dead in the water.

I'm not even supposed to be here.

This universe has some sense of humor.


===========ID 0x00003D1C: I joined this crew at the behest of my mentor. Good fellow. Honest, straight shooter.

They told me this job would be a real tough one. I'd be paid for my trouble, whether I made it out alive or not. 

That's all I needed to know. Death doesn't scare me. Being poor's another story. 
===========ID 0x00003D1F: Let me be clear. I am in pain. Excruciating, debilitating pain. And let me tell you, it would be so much easier if I just put syringe to vein and ended my life.

But I am going to continue to fight. I will look the reaper in the eye and tell him to screw off. I will take out my calculator and count down every last breath until he grows bored and leaves. 

I am not fighting just for me. I am fighting for this crew. I love every one of these ridiculous bastards, and if my pain means they have a 0.01% better chance of living, then I will endure it, and do it with a smile.

I am in pain. But I am not dead yet.
===========ID 0x00003D21: The ship hasn't been the same since the attack.

We've repaired the hull and interior the best we could, but none of the systems are running as efficiently as we're used to. 

We're going to need to run a full diagnostic once we return to port. There's something we're missing here.
===========ID 0x00003D22: My hands feel clammy. 

I have a headache.

Nausea's setting in. 

This is not good.
===========ID 0x00003D25: 

<p align='center'>HELP US</p>
===========ID 0x00003D27: I've got a bad feeling about this mission. I've been exploring the cosmos for ages and I'm never wrong about this stuff. 

Nevertheless, I trust the Captain with my life. Poor decisions will kill you out here, and they have yet to let me down on that front.

Just gotta trust the process. So long as that's solid, the rest is just fortune's frown.
===========ID 0x00003D29: I want to take a long trip
With no destination
Because it takes a lot of guts
To take a step
In the wrong direction
To leave a life 
You thought was your future
To let go of something
That you always wanted




===========ID 0x00003D2A: I've worked so hard to get on this ship, and now I feel like everything's paying off.

There's a lot of pressure, sure, but nothing I can't handle.

This is honestly a dream come true. When I look out into space, I'm so happy, I just want to cry.
===========ID 0x00003D2C: When are you coming home? You said you'd be back weeks ago.

This isn't the first time you've lied about this. I get that your job is important but at some point you need to set better boundaries with your employers.

When you get back, we should really have a talk about striking a better work-life balance.
===========ID 0x00003D2F: I miss home so much.

It's so lonely out here, and things are constantly in disrepair. I don't have many other friends on the crew, so even if there's a quiet moment I don't have anyone to spend it with.

I am just not having a good time right now and I really hope that changes, but I won't hold my breath.
===========ID 0x00003D31: There's so many things I'm never going to be able to do again.

Eat at my favorite restaurant. 

Drink my favorite beer.

Watch the sunset.

But it was all worth it to live amongst the stars.



===========ID 0x00003D32: I don't like the way the Captain flies the ship.

It's reckless. I think I could do a way better job. People don't know this about me, but I'm in the Vanguard. Aced the test and everything.

I wonder if I can get some kind of diploma from MAST. I'll have to ask the Star Parcel guy next time he delivers a package.
===========ID 0x00003D35: Tested the samples we got from the last survey.

The results were inconclusive. I'm going to need to do some more tests.

And here I thought I'd get a day off.
===========ID 0x00003D37: Everyone's rooting for you back home!

I know this is your first foray into SPACE, but we love you and know you're going to rock it out there! If you're ever in doubt about anything, just remember everyone back home believes in you!

Now get back out there and kick butt!
===========ID 0x00003D39: The ship's been making too much noise lately.

I'll ask the Captain if we can have the technicians run a checkup when we dock.

Never can be too cautious.
===========ID 0x00003D3B: This sucks. Really, really sucks.

Honestly, I just want something to drink.

If I'm going to go out, I don't want to be sober.
===========ID 0x00003D3D: It's hard to believe this is how it ends.

I don't really have regrets, save the one. Before I die, I just want to know the answer.

If I asked, would they have said yes?

Maybe in another life, I'd know for sure.
===========ID 0x00003D3F: At times like this, I remember the words of an old Freestar explorer, which I'll quote here:

Out here in the void of space, there is little hope we'll survive, and little hope we will be found. 

But I hold on to that small hope, for that is what it means to be human. That is what it means to have faith.

So the fact that you are reading this now, that you have overcome the insurmountable odds to arrive at this tiny speck in the cosmos, that means something. We are connected, you and I, as is this entire universe, a miracle written in stardust. And so, we can never be alone.

===========ID 0x00003D41: I wish I had done more. Seen more.

I can't stop thinking about all those years I wasted. All those times I thought about doing something, anything, and just finding my way back to bed.

Then I finally did it. I signed up for this crew and went out into space.

And just like that, I'm out of time. Isn't that always how it is?
===========ID 0x00003D42: List of things to do today:

1. Get ready
2. Get dressed
3. Brush teeth
4. Eat breakfast
5. Check maintenance logs
6. Run diagnostics
7. Daydream
8. Run more diagnostics
9. Eat dinner
10. Sleep
===========ID 0x00003D44: Are you eating well? I've read terrible things about space diets.

Next time you're planetside, I am going to cook you the biggest meal.

Love,
Mom
===========ID 0x00003D47: We hope you're doing great out there. 

Just want to let you know Mom and I are so very proud of you.

Love,
Dad
===========ID 0x00003D49: Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep; 

When in the morning light I wake, show me the path of love to take.
===========ID 0x00003D4B: We've got some damage to the exterior hull and interior pipes. For the pipe repair job, I'm going to need:

Sealants - 3
Structural Resources - 2
Fibers - 2
Metals - 4
===========ID 0x00003D4C: I'm sorry you had to find out this way, but I'm leaving you.

I've already arranged for your stuff to be packed up, you can pick it up when you get back.

I know this feels like the end of the world, but it will get better. I promise.
===========ID 0x00003D4F: I need to do some routine maintenance on the shields. 

We're heading into some dangerous territory over the next few weeks and you never know.

My checklist:

Power distribution
Shield integrity
EM radiation protection
Energy transfer
Deflection/Absorption
Wear and tear
Driver updates
===========ID 0x00003D51: I'm so nervous about this job, but the Captain says it's just first time jitters.

I hope they're right.
===========ID 0x00003D53: Just want to tell you we miss you and can't wait to see you again!

The little one's growing up so fast. By the time you get back you won't even recognize them.

Love you
===========ID 0x00003D54: In order to ensure our supplies last for the duration of the mission, we're keeping the vast majority under lock and key.

I'm in charge of access. I'm sure exceptions will need to be made, but for the most part, nobody else can use the container.
===========ID 0x00003D57: With supplies running low, we've decided to ration. 

To make sure people stick to the rules, I've kept the remaining supplies locked away.
===========ID 0x00003D58: We've decided to keep some of the more fungible items locked away for safekeeping. 

I've been entrusted with the key. No one's going to be selling these to Trade Authority any time soon.
===========ID 0x00003D5B: I decided to keep some of my valuables locked away from the rest of the group.

When things get rough, self-preservation takes hold. Nobody here can use a digipick, and I have the only key.
===========ID 0x00003D5C: I've locked away all the valuables we've collected from the last mission. 

I'm trusting you to keep them safe.
===========ID 0x00003D5F: You left some of your valuables in my quarters again.

I went ahead and left them in the locked container so nobody else takes them. Use this key to open it.
===========ID 0x00003D61: I don't trust anyone on board, so we'll need to keep our stash separate from the others. Here's your key.

We'll take turns guarding it, depending on our shifts.
===========ID 0x00003D63: Don't tell anyone about the cache. Your job is to just bring it on board, and deliver it when you dock.

Don't worry, your ID and backstory will check out. Use this key to keep it safe.
===========ID 0x00003D65: I know the Captain won't approve of us bringing that extra crate on board. 

So I've stashed it away somewhere private. Here's the key.
===========ID 0x00003D67: Hey I know you don't like gifts but we thought it might be useful if we sent you a few things via Star Parcel.

The key's inside. Feel free to share it with the rest of the crew if you like.
===========ID 0x00003D69: If you find this note, please return my ID to my family at the Sanctum Universum in New Atlantis.

I hope finding out what happened to me will give them peace.
===========ID 0x00003D6E: I know that you're stealing ship parts during repairs. Don't bother trying to deny it, I've seen you do it. 

As your friend, I'm telling you that you gotta knock it off. You know where you are, right? Do you understand who you're stealing from, whose shit your messing with? 

Listen, I'm not gonna tell anyone what you've been doing, but you have to stop before things get ugly. And they will definitely get ugly.
===========ID 0x00003D6F: If there's a heaven, this is it. I never want to leave. 

Shady deals, gambling, edible food, and more booze than I can drink... What else could a man possibly ask for? 
===========ID 0x00003D71: WARNING!

Pirates have tracked one of the delivery ships back to our location. All facility workers are expected to follow emergency protocol: 

1.) If able, destroy all confidential information and proprietary technology

2.) Follow evacuation procedures as described by your supervisor

I've been with DRONE for five years working in the sales office at Ryujin Tower. While I've enjoyed the experience, it's always been my dream to work on the robots themselves which is why I'm hoping to get your approval to request a transfer to the Ryujin Industries R&D team.

Please, please, please just let me! Working on sales is killing me... and the PEOPLE. I need to get out of here.
===========ID 0x00006473: Hey family,

I wanted to let you all know that I made it to Neon safe and sound. The Ryujin Apartments are really nice, thank God, and I've already made a few new friends. Getting to know the city has been fun so far. It's sooo different. Also, don't let Gran know, but there's no Sanctum Universum here.

Ryujin Tower is very impressive. Much fancier than the office in New Atlantis. We're on a floor with DRONE and Tranquilitea, so it's nice to take a break and play with the bots or relax in a lobby designed for actual comfort.

I think I'm going to like it here even though I'll miss you all. I'll try and make plans for a vacation soon!

Love and miss you,

Though we've only known each other for five years, I hope you know by now that I think of you as my own. I'm so proud of the young woman you've become, and I want you to know that I'll always love and support you.

Because of this, I'd like to ask your permission to officially adopt you. It would be my honor to be a permanent part of your life. I know it may seem strange since you're already an adult, but I fully intend to grow old with your mother so should anything happen along the way, I want you to know that I have every intention of being there.

This is a big decision, so please take any time that you need. There's no pressure to say yes. I know you already think of me as your father, and that will always be enough.

It's the largest bust we've ever made, but the top-side security office doesn't want it. I think they'd rather keep it down here, so it looks like we're making busts every week.

In reality, we can't even afford to put a camera out in the yard. That safe is a security risk.

I can't believe the Freestar Rangers are looking for me again! I thout my last trick worked, but they saw throuh it. Ranger Maman chaised me all the way from Akila City to my secret base. And when I got there Ranger Papa was wating for me! But I got away by hiding behind another planet. 

They want my tresure and Ranger Papa says they aren't going to stop chaising me until I give it to them. But I would never do that. Pirates don't share our tresure! 

I think it's time to use one of my speshial plans. But I'll think about it tonight after diner.

===========ID 0x0000649D: Captin's Log - 

Ha ha ha! The Freestar Rangers will never find my tresure now! My speshial plan worked. I have put my tresure in a secret place outside of my base, and only I know where it is. Ranger Maman and Ranger Papa looked for it all of today and couldn't find it, so I know the place is very secret.

After I hid my tresure, it was time for my next adventur. Today I explored around a colony, and met a very nice owner of a store. They said it was a good idea for me to make a treasur map, so my treasur was easy to find. I said that real pirates don't make maps, because we always remember where we put our treasur!

The owner of the store gave me some candy so I would not be hungry on my way home to my secret base. I hid some of it with my treasur. Maybe someone will find it and have a snack. 

Tomorrow, I will fight the Freestar Rangers again, so they never find my tresure!

Today was my best day as a pirate. I have looked for the space tresure of Compass Rose for so long and now it is mine!! I had to fight so many Freestar Rangers to get it, but they didn't stop me. Ranger Maman and Ranger Papa saw me take the tresure but I blastid them with my ship and got away. But don't wory I didn't hurt them, they just fell over. 

Now that I have the tresure, I need to be sure it will be safe. The Freestar Rangers will be still looking for it. I will take it to the wizard at the farm, and ask if he will do a spell to make it safe. I bet he will.

This is the best day ever!

I know how hard it is to lose a colleague, especially a friend like Raf. We may not be explorers or soldiers, but there is a measure of risk even in our line of work. He accepted that. We all did.

There was nothing wrong with your test. And knowing Rafael, I'm quite sure he was deliberate and careful. Whatever happened, it was an accident.

===========ID 0x000064B1: INCIDENT REPORT
Author: Maria Hughes, Chief Scientist
Date of Incident: Revolution 8, Day 64
Time of Incident: 00:58

At 21:00 on Day 63, I requested that Chief Engineer Rafael Aguerro conduct an out-of-band frequency calibration test on the probe to assess the interference pattern noted by the research team earlier in the day.

Pursuant to that request, he was alone in the lab at the time of the incident. According to data gathered by the Probe Control Unit, the calibration test triggered a catastrophic feedback loop that overloaded the lab's control system and caused a cascading series of failures, including the destruction of key failsafes, the explosion of volatile storage tanks, and a major cave-in or collapse of unknown severity. Rafael is presumed to have died in the explosion.

The incident triggered an automated security lockdown on the research level. As the incident also destroyed our connection to the research level's control system, we have been unable to lift the lockdown or access the lab.

The Probe Control Unit indicates that the probe somehow survived the incident and continues to run, albeit in a damaged state, at an unstable frequency outside designated experimental parameters. All attempts to shut it down remotely have failed.

I accept full responsibility for the entire incident, including the loss of Mr. Aguerro, the destruction of our facilities, and the irreparable damage to our research program.
===========ID 0x000064B5: INCIDENT REPORT
Author: Kaia Patel, Director
Date of Incident: Revolution 8, Day 64
Time of Incident: 00:58

Shortly after midnight, a series of explosions in the High Energy Research Lab triggered a security lockdown. A brief release of hydrogen gas was detected in air interchange system, along with particulates indicative of a major collapse or severe damage to lab facilities.

Chief of Security E. HUGHES canceled the lockdown for the surface facility at 04:30, but all communication with the research level and its control systems has been lost.

Chief Engineer R. AGUERRO is missing, presumed dead. Security logs indicate he was alone in the lab at the time of the incident. All other personnel are accounted for. No other injuries reported.

===========ID 0x000064B9: Raf -

Sorry for the late-night test request. We finally dialed in the voltage this morning, but we've been having trouble calibrating the frequency waveform. Output sensors all look fine, but the intake sensors are showing some kind of phase-shift interference, like we're picking up a reflection of our own beam within the distortion.

For tomorrow's test, we need an intake frequency of 34Ghz, but I can't find an output that gets us there. I've left you a slate with the calibration protocol in the control room, but you'll probably have to experiment with it, as usual. Good luck with this one.

===========ID 0x0000884A: Commercial Reproductions of Earth Fauna

Throughout human history, replicas of Earth animals were used in many different ways, from toys and games, to more practical uses such as these items. 

Piggy Bank, Left.
As far back as the 15th century, hollowed-out ceramic statue of the animal known as "pig" were popularly used to store physical currency.

Decoy Duck, Right.
Water fowl, known as "ducks" were once hunted near Earth's marshes for sport and food using ballistic rifles. To facilitate this activity, hunters would often place wooden decoy ducks in the water and use a small woodwind instrument to produce an accompanying call resembling that of the duck in order to lure it in.
===========ID 0x0000884C: Scale Model of the RV Calypso

Originally commisioned by the British Royal Navy as a minesweeper vessel and launched in 1942, it was later repurposed by famed Earth oceanographic researcher, Jacques Cousteau in 1950. Cousteau dedicated his life to exploring Earth's oceans, further and deeper than anyone before him. During his expeditions he formed a deeper understanding of the sea's fragile ecosystems, and became an advocate for ocean preservation.
===========ID 0x0000884E: A range of antique Earth computers, ranging from the late 1980's to the mid 2000's.

Computers have existed in some form since Charles Babbage's Difference Engine in 1822. The years from the mid 20th century into the early 21st century were known for some of the greatest advances in computing technology, as computers shrank from gigiantic room-sized devices filled with vacuum tubes, to small boxes filled with microprocessors like the ones you see here.
===========ID 0x00008850: Antique Intrument of Unknown Origin, Earth

Believed to be of West African origin, possibly a type of Ngoni, a harp-like string instrument traditionally used in ceremonies accompanied with chanting and storytelling. This instrument was generously donated to the New Homestead museum, but its true origin is unfortunately lost to time.

===========ID 0x00008854: Ice Hockey stick, used on Earth in the city of Edmonton, Canada, during a 1988 championship game.

Ice Hockey is a contact sport played on an ice rink where two teams with five players and two goal tenders, called "goalies" compete to deposit a rubberized "puck" in the other team's goal. The players traverse the rink on specialized shoes mounted on thin metal blades, called ice skates, and manipulate the puck with specialized curved sticks such as the one displayed here. 
===========ID 0x00008857: To land on a planet, select a landmark or place a landing marker with [PlaceMarker]. Then, press and hold [XButton] to land.

To take off, simply return to your ship and hold [TakeOff] when in the pilot's seat.
===========ID 0x0000885A: Your starship can have up to 3 different weapons. To fire them, press either [WeaponGroup1], [WeaponGroup2], or [WeaponGroup3]. You can fire all of your different weapons at the same time. 

Weapons can have two firing types - Auto and Manual. Auto Turrets rotate and aim independently of a ship's orientation and are fired automatically without a pilot's input. Manual Weapons are fired by the pilot in the direction the ship is facing.

To lock on to an enemy ship, select your target with [Activate] and keep the enemy centered on your screen. When you are fully locked on, the word "Lock" will display on the targeted enemy. An enemy can break your lock by boosting, moving out of range, or maneuvering outside of your targeting systems, so make sure to keep them in your sights! Similarly, when trying to evade attacks, boosting can reduce enemy accuracy and break a missile lock.

Locking onto an enemy ship makes aiming easier, and allows missile weapons to home-in on enemy ships. You can even disable specific parts of enemy ships, like their weapon and shield systems, if you damage them enough. If an enemy ship's system is disabled, they will no longer be able to use it. For example, if you disable a ship's engines, the enemy will not be able to move.

If you have the "Targeting Control Systems" skill unlocked, you can target specific parts of an enemy ship. With this skill unlocked, when you are locked onto a target, you can press [XButton] to target a ship's systems. While targeting systems, use [Move] to select a system. Then, simply fire your weapons to damage it. This makes it much easier to strategically disable a ship's systems.

Then, they will engage in combat with unmarked ships. They will be led to belive the ships are unmanned, but they will be surprisingly difficult to fight. Afterwards, they will be instructed to land and return to Jules

Thanks in part to the development of the Grav Drive, humanity will live on.
===========ID 0x000089A4: While long-term missions in space began in the late 1990s with programs such as the International Space Station, humanity began living on other planets almost 100 years later. Small outposts of 5 or fewer scientific research teams eventually gave way to entire colony effort on Mars and other orbiting bodies of our solar system.
===========ID 0x000089AD: NASA partnered with Nova Galactic, the creators of the Voltaire supercomputer, on an ambitious aerospace project to "pull" gravity itself. The result is the first spacecraft capable of faster than light travel. The first successful voyage saw astronauts reaching Jupiter in moments what would've previously taken years.
===========ID 0x000089AF: NASA, one of several Earth-based space agencies, was instrumental in humankind's earliest journeys into space. Indeed, it was due to the efforts of NASA that New Homestead exists. In 2107, NASA sent an unmanned probe to Titan, which paved the way for the development of the Titan Astrobase, completed in 2130. By 2185, the Titan Astrobase project was transitioned into the colony of New Homestead.

For most powered objects, you can run a wire directly to them. Some small objects like lights get power from a nearby Power Connector.

To run a wire, switch to Modify mode using [Cancel], highlight the object, and press [RTrigger]. All valid targets will be highlighted. Highlight the object you want to run a wire to and press [RTrigger] to create the link.

As well, I've added a "Last Time on UC Playtesting" story recap which you can access with the following console command:
setstage UC04 15

LONDINION
You're going to be hearing a lot about a place called "Londinion" going forward. The earlier quests have all been updated to teach the player about this place, but you should know the following:

- It was once a thriving settlement, but it's since been completely overrun by Terrormorphs
- The Terrormorph sample you found on Tau Ceti (where you met Hadrian), back in UC02 is an exact match for tissue from Londinion, meaning the outbreak that happened there could happen anywhere.

THE VANGUARD
The player has already recieved permission from this Vanguard commander to persue this line of inquiry. The player working with Hadrian is all above board.

ROBOVOICE
A substantial amount of robovoice never got overwritten when I finished this quest. I've tried to correct the spots I found, but these do your best to see past it if you encounter it.
===========ID 0x000089D3: PREVIOUSLY ON THE UC

The player joined the UC Vanguard, the UC's volunteer fleet, and traveled to Tau Ceti, only to find the young settlement there destroyed by a Terrormorph. There they met Hadrian Sanon, an alien researcher who informed the player the Terrormorph on Tau Ceti could be a sign more Terrormorph attacks are on the horizon.

The player took a sample of that Terrormorph's tissue to Mars, where it was verified by Jakob Halliday, a fellow alien researcher and friend of Hadrian's. Jakob verified that the sample was bad - it matched those found on Londinion, a planet wiped out by Terromorphs. 

Hadrian returned and suggested a course of action - asking the UC Cabinet, the heads of the UC, for Terrormorph research data Jakob and Hadrian previously collected as members of the now-disbanded UC Xenowarfare team.

As the player starts this quest, they're going to meet Hadrian outside MAST to speak to the Cabinet.
===========ID 0x000089D6: TEMP MESSAGE

In final, this interaction will play sound fx and remove vfx of sparks/fire/etc
===========ID 0x000089D8: Placing an outpost beacon allows you to build objects and structures.

Navigate the build menu categories using [LShoulder:14] and [RShoulder:14]. Switch to Modify mode using [Cancel:14].

Outpost objects are built from items and resources. When building an object, the build costs are automatically removed from your ship's cargo hold or your inventory.
===========ID 0x000089DA: DESIGNER NOTE: At this point, a radiant quest would start up for the player to take care of, but since those haven't been 1st passed yet, we're just going to wrap things here.

Thanks for playing the UC questline!
===========ID 0x000089DD: DESIGNER NOTE: There will be multiple variations of this line based on the results of UC05. For first pass, I'm assuming you did the golden path - got the factions working together.
===========ID 0x000089E4: Which Companion did you romance?
===========ID 0x000089E8: In the Crimson Fleet questline, did you side with SysDef or the Crimson Fleet?
===========ID 0x000089ED: In the Freestar Collective questline, did you kill Ron Hope, accept his bribe, or let him go to spare his company?
===========ID 0x000089F1: In the Ryujin Industries questline, did you promote mass production of the interal neuroamp or keep it secret?
===========ID 0x000089F2: Pipe has sprung a leak!
===========ID 0x000089F3: You've completed the Armillary. Once you power up your Grav Drive, you'll jump to the Unity. Remove the Armillary from your ship if you need to grav jump to anywhere else!
===========ID 0x000089F4: Your adventures start over, although you might notice some differences...
===========ID 0x000089F5: Press [Monocle] to open the ship scanner. Use [Look] to aim your ship at points of interest. Hover your cursor over a target to select it. Or press [SelectTarget] to cycle between all available targets.

Select "Kreet Research Lab" then press [XButton] to start the landing sequence.

Pressing [XButton] with just Kreet selected will open the Planet Map, where you can also select a landing target and get a detailed view of the surface.
===========ID 0x000089F6: Press [DataMenu] to open the Data Menu. From there, you can open the Map (which will be the section in the upper left).
===========ID 0x000089F7: DESIGNER NOTE: At this point, Kaiser would play an animation to have him restore his various systems and whatnot as he gets out of his furniture.
===========ID 0x000089F9: You load into the computer system and manage to find a divide-by-zero error that has brought the entire system down. You manage to locate the source of the error and fix the code. The system starts back up and looks to be fully operational.
===========ID 0x000089FA: DESIGNER NOTE: When the player enters this room, it would be thick with haze and their vision would begin to blur. There would also be turrets that harry them as they make their way through the space.
===========ID 0x000089FC: Builders can create a variety of items, but require resources in order to do so. You can change what a builder creates using the attached console.

In order to provide the builder the resources it needs, create output links to it from extractors or other sources of resources.

To create an output link, switch to Modify mode using [Cancel:14], highlight the object, and press [RTrigger]. All valid targets will be highlighted. Highlight the object you want to send the object's output to and press [Confirm:14] to create the link.
===========ID 0x000089FD: In order to board a hostile ship, you must disable the ship's engines. For some ships, like this one, the engines will also go offline if the ship is reduced to zero health.
===========ID 0x000089FF: By creating an output link from the <Alias=SourceObject>, everything it produces will be automatically sent to the <Alias=TargetObject>.

Output links are useful for storing the output of Extractors and Builders; they are also essential for providing Builders with their required resources.
===========ID 0x00008A01: By creating a chain of output links, incoming items will fill up the storage container at the end of the chain first. This is useful for providing storage for the output of extractors and builders.
===========ID 0x00008A03: By creating an output link to the <Alias=TargetObject>, it can draw the resources it needs from the <Alias=SourceObject>.

You can link the output from as many storage containers, extractors and builders as you want to a builder in order to provide the resources for its current build recipe.
===========ID 0x00008A05: When you are within range of a powered Scan Booster, the range of your scanner is greatly increased.
===========ID 0x00008A08: A Cargo Link allows you to transfer items between outposts. Once you've built a Cargo Link in two different outposts, you can use the attached control console to link the two outposts.

Items in the Outgoing container will be transported to the Incoming container in the other outpost, and vice-versa. Create output links to the Outgoing container to ship goods to the other outpost; create output links from the Incoming container to use goods shipped from the other outpost.

The Basic Cargo Link can be used to link outposts in the same system; the Inter-System Cargo Link can be used to link outposts in different systems, but requires He3 to operate.
===========ID 0x00008A0F: Most starstations and ships can be docked with, allowing you to board them. You will need to select the ship in your HUD and then fly close enough to it so that the Dock prompt appears.
===========ID 0x00008A15: Planet surveys may require you to explore multiple planet biomes. Try landing at different spots on the planet if you run out of things to scan.

Landmark, Life Signs, and Hazard map icons will point you to areas where you can discover noteworthy planetary traits.

Build an Outpost with a Scan Booster to increase your scanner's range.
===========ID 0x00008A18: Shut down the experiment and select this reality?
===========ID 0x00008A19: MicroCell recipe learned.
===========ID 0x00008A1D: This requires a GalBank Transfer Module.
===========ID 0x00008A1E: The GalBank Transfer Module is locked in place.
===========ID 0x00008A1F: You can now move the Armillary. Starborn attacks are more likely wherever the Armillary is placed. If you choose to keep the Artifacts in your inventory, then attacks are more likely everywhere.
===========ID 0x00008A22: The Vault Control Console isn't responding.
===========ID 0x00008A23: Most hostile ships can be boarded once the ship engines are down. You must fly close to the ship before you will be allowed to dock. Once you board, expect the crew on the ship to fight back!
===========ID 0x00008A24: In order to board a hostile ship, you must disable the ship's engines. For some ships, like this one, the engines will also go offline if the ship is reduced to zero health.
===========ID 0x00008A27: DESIGNER NOTE: For first pass, the "Golden Path" I chose was the player, Hadrian and Jakob agreeing to not tell the Cabinet about the Lazarus plant or Vae Victis' involvement in the attacks. 

You can select those options in this scene currently, but they're not supported when you address the Cabinet.

Just know that stuff's coming (and Hadrian and Jakob will react appropriately based on the players actions in this scene).
===========ID 0x00008A2A: One of your ship systems has been damaged! 

Power is automatically removed from systems for each point of damage. If a system is completely damaged, that system will be offline.

You can repair ship systems by re-allocating power to the damaged systems. Systems will also repair themselves automatically when combat is over.
===========ID 0x00008A2B: Your ship's Hull integrity is low! If it drops to zero, your ship will explode.

Press [RepairShip] to repair your ship. This consumes Ship Parts.
===========ID 0x00008A2D: The Reactor Override Control is not responding.
===========ID 0x00008A2E: DESIGNER NOTE: Essential doesn't play nicely with Terrormorphs just yet, so Hadrian and Kaiser will be doing their scene in reference to a marker until that bug is fixed.
===========ID 0x00008A2F: You weld the panel shut, but something behind it begins smoking.
===========ID 0x00008A30: The GalBank Data Core is locked in place.
===========ID 0x00008A31: You assemble the parts and then spend some time installing them in the scanning equipment.
===========ID 0x00008A32: You assemble the parts, but as you hook them up to the scanning equipment, they start to spark and smoke.
===========ID 0x00008A33: You pick up a wrench and help Sarah tighten up the new equipment around the room.
===========ID 0x00008A35: Floor is inaccessible.
===========ID 0x00008A37: Build something that requires power.
===========ID 0x00008A39: From 1965 -- 1966. In many ways, Project Gemini was a "learning mission." While NASA's ultimate goal was to put a human being on the Moon, many questions had to be answered before that project (Apollo) could even begin. Gemini was tasked with answering how a person could survive in space over many days, how to connect spacecraft together, and how to improve spacesuit technology to operate outside of spacecraft.
===========ID 0x00008A3E: The computer is unpowered.
===========ID 0x00008A3F: You notice some auxiliary power banks in the next room. They appear to use standard Power Cells.
===========ID 0x00008A40: You swap out the broken Power Cells and the computer powers up again.
===========ID 0x00008A41: You bypass the broken circuitry and the computer powers up again.
===========ID 0x00008A42: You pull out some data components and download the contents on to a slate. It appears to be an audio transmission.
===========ID 0x00008A47: You can easily transfer items between an outpost and your ship by building a Transfer Container.

To fill the Transfer Container, create output links to it from extractors and builders.
===========ID 0x00008A4D: Target the enemy ship using [SelectTarget].

Use [WeaponGroup1], [WeaponGroup2], and [WeaponGroup3] to fire your ship's weapons.

Your ship has a special targeting mode to help automatically hit with your weapons. Press [SelectTarget] to target a ship. Keep the target under the reticle to lock-on, and then [XButton] to enter targeting mode.
===========ID 0x00008A50: Sometimes you may want to wait in order to pass the time of day. To do this, you must sit on a piece of furniture. When sitting, press [StartWait]. You will then be prompted to enter the amount of hours you'd like to wait. You can cancel waiting by pressing [Cancel]. To get up from furniture, press [Activate]. Waiting passes the time of day, but it will not heal you. 

Sleeping is different from waiting, as it both heals you and passes time. It will also give you the "Well Rested" benefit, which increases your XP gained for a limited time. Sleeping is the only way you can gain this benefit.  

When you wait or sleep on a planet, you will pass both Local and Universal time. In space, you will only pass Universal time. Local time is the time of the planet you are currently on, and will be different from planet to planet. For example, if it is 12:00 Local time on Jemison, it will not be 12:00 Local time on Mars.

Conversely, Universal time is the standard time throughout the universe, and is the same on any planet, ship, or station. For example, if the Universal time on Jemison is 12:00, the same is true for Mars.

Local time is oftentimes very different from Universal time, and passing Local time may not result in the same amount of Universal time passed. For example, waiting 24 Local hours on Neon will not pass 24 hours of Universal time. 
===========ID 0x00008A56: You pick up a wrench and help tighten down the equipment, but there's a spark, and a small explosion of smoke from one of the electric boxes.
===========ID 0x00008A59: Use [Left][Right] to select a ship system. Use [Up][Down] to allocate power.

You can skip the Ship Tutorial by powering up all systems, including the Grav Drive.
===========ID 0x00008A5A: Press [QuickInventory] to open your inventory.
===========ID 0x00008A5B: Press [DataMenu] to open the data menu. From there, you can open your Inventory (which will be the section in the lower right).
===========ID 0x00008A5D: Hold [Monocle] to turn the flashlight on and off.
===========ID 0x00008A5E: Hold [Monocle] to turn the flashlight on and off.
===========ID 0x00008A5F: Grav Drive Repaired (Taskmaster)
===========ID 0x00008A70: TBD: The Player holds up the Watch and a scanning FX plays.
===========ID 0x00008A76: Extractors harvest resources over time. Most have to be placed on a resource vein; some resources can be harvested from the atmosphere.

Once the extractor's inventory is full, it will stop producing. If you create an output link to a storage container of the matching type, the extractor's output will go directly into it.

To create an output link, switch to Modify mode using [Cancel:14], highlight the object, and press [RTrigger]. All valid targets will be highlighted. Highlight the object you want to send the object's output to and press [Confirm:14] to create the link.
===========ID 0x00008A82: DESIGNER NOTE: In the future, the body will be in a puddle of blood, clearly the victim of some sort of violence.
===========ID 0x00008A83: A mission to locate a planet trait is the most challenging survey mission. You will need to search an entire solar system for a planet that has the target trait.

Locate planets in the target system that have traits. This is indicated at the bottom of a planet's info card on the starmap. Unsurveyed planets will have "Unknown" traits.
===========ID 0x00008A85: DESIGNER NOTE: After the 1st pass of this quest was finished, we decided to swap out Kaiser for Hadrian as the Elite Crew you can pick up for this quest. Both Percival and Hadrian's scene's will be largely rewritten to handle this fact, so I wouldn't waste too much time on them now.
===========ID 0x00008A87: No Power Cell in Inventory
===========ID 0x00008A89: Power Cell Already Inserted
===========ID 0x00008A8A: You are not allowed transport while in combat.
===========ID 0x00008A8B: This quickstart has set your level to 24.
===========ID 0x00008A90: The ComSpike Module is now available at any Ship Services Tech.
===========ID 0x00008A93: As you start hooking up the wires, they start to spark and smoke.
===========ID 0x00008A94: You hook up the remaining wires and the Research Lab comes online.
===========ID 0x00008A97: Wait until the memorial service starts?
===========ID 0x00008A9D: Warning: your ship doesn't have enough shielded cargo capacity for this amount of contraband.

Accept mission?
===========ID 0x00008AA6: Turrets at the entrance and sniper towers at the far end of the base.
===========ID 0x00008AA8: Watch the heavy gunner back by the shooting range.
===========ID 0x00008AB0: Lopez's Farm
===========ID 0x00008AB3: Lemaire Satellite
===========ID 0x00008AB7: Wen Satellite
===========ID 0x00008AB9: The Conduction Grid Module is now available at any Ship Services Tech.
===========ID 0x00008AC2: DESIGNER NOTE: The player will recieve a misc pointer to Sloan at this point. 
===========ID 0x00008AC3: DESIGNER NOTE: The player will recieve the 1st ER settlement quest at this point, once that's in.
===========ID 0x00008AC8: This requires an ID Card.
===========ID 0x00008AC9: DESIGNER NOTE: We're still working on getting the dungeon set up for this quest, so for now, you're just going to be heading to a temp interior until we get that all squared away. Know that in the future, between you and this slate, there will be a collect of robotic and turret enemies.
===========ID 0x00008ACA: DESIGNER NOTE: In second pass, I plan to add options to speak to some or all of the members of the Retreat and add support for as many of their options as I can in the confrontation.
===========ID 0x00008ACD: Kreet Crawler
===========ID 0x00008AD1: Kreet Crawler
===========ID 0x00008AD3: Kreet Crawler
===========ID 0x00008AD5: Kreet Crawler
===========ID 0x00008ADA: DESIGNER NOTE: At this point, the player would be directed to a dungeon to find Kilman, but the PCM's busted as of the time of this this first pass, so you'll find him just outside the retreat.
===========ID 0x00008ADB: Minimize ship system power to avoid detection. Systems like weapons and shields are easier to detect. 

For maximum stealth, power down all systems except one or two bars in your Engines, and stay as far away from enemy ships as you can.

Get within 500m of the Satellite Beacon so that you can activate it.
===========ID 0x00008ADC: This alarm has been disabled.
===========ID 0x00008AE0: Only Freestar Rangers can access this mission board.
===========ID 0x00008AE1: You attempt to load into the computer system, but you can't make heads or tails of the error that has brought the entire system down. You feel that if you had the Security skill, you might be able to fix it, but for the time being the computer remains inoperable.
===========ID 0x00008AE4: Tawny Adams
===========ID 0x00008AE8: Kreet Crawler
===========ID 0x00008AEA: Ada
===========ID 0x00008AEB: You have gained Self-Esteem (Empath)

===========ID 0x00008AEF: Weapons Repaired (Taskmaster)
===========ID 0x00008AF0: Engines Repaired (Taskmaster)
===========ID 0x00008AF1: Shields Repaired (Taskmaster)
===========ID 0x00008AF5: This action is not allowed while in combat.
===========ID 0x00008AF6: There's currently a bug with getting the player directed to the right location inside the dungeon. Please use the following console command to jump to the right spot (as though you've just sat to wait for the arrival of the Trackers):

setstage City_ER_Exorcism 4
===========ID 0x00008AF7: You now have elevator access to Research and Development.
===========ID 0x00008AF9: Only members of Constellation can access this mission board.
===========ID 0x00008AFF: Banda Satellite
===========ID 0x00008B01: Press [Monocle] to bring up the scanner. You can use the scanner to analyze alien creatures and plant life.
===========ID 0x00008B07: Press [Monocle] to open your Scanner and target the person you want to Manipulate.

Press [Activate] to bring up your Social Skills and select Manipulation.

Once a person has been manipulated, select the object or person you want them to interact with.
===========ID 0x00008B08: You are not authorized to pilot this ship.
===========ID 0x00008B0D: Outposts are bases that you can create on any habitable planet. 

You can build numerous types of modules and items at outposts, including: 

- Habs - you can build habs for a shelter. You can even decorate and build furniture. 

- Defenses - these protect your outpost from hostiles. 

- Extractors - these modules create resources like copper or water. See the "Outpost - Extractors" entry for more details on extractors.

- Robots - provide benefits similar to human Crew, such as increased production rate.

- Crafting - crafting stations like a weapons workbench, industrial workbench, and pharmaceutical lab.

- Storage - structures that allow you to store and transfer resources. 

- Power - machines that supply power to your outpost and its systems. 

- Builders - can build a variety of items but require resources to do so. Many builders let you pick from a menu of items that can be produced. 

Outposts can be built on any planet, but the Planetary Habitation skill allows you to build outposts on planets with more extreme conditions.

Skills in the Science skill tree can be helpful for building outposts. Some examples are Outpost Engineering, Planetary Habitation, and Geology. 

You can fast travel to your outposts when exploring, and you can land your ship at them. 
===========ID 0x00008B11: When hailing, you can threaten another starship into giving you their cargo. Your chances of a successful piracy attempt are determined by how powerful the starship is, and the value of its cargo. Here are some possible examples: 

- If a starship is much weaker than yours or cannot fight back, you're not likely to meet any resistance. 

- If a starship's relative power is about the same as yours, they will resist. You will have to either attack the ship or successfully Persuade them in order to gain their cargo. To learn more about persuasion, view the "Persuasion" entry.

- If a starship is more powerful than yours, it will not willingly give up its cargo. You must either attack it or give up. 

A weaker ship may show resistance if its cargo is extremely valuable. 
===========ID 0x00008B14: Starships are vital to exploring the Settled Systems. You can buy, find, and steal different starships, or build one yourself. 

There are multiple classes of starships: 

A - Low firepower but high mobility

B - Moderate firepower and moderate mobility

C - High firepower and low mobility

New ships can be purchased from Ship Services Technicians and Staryards in major cities throughout the galaxy.

You can modify your starships by visiting a Ship Services Technician. For more info, see the "Ship Modification" entry.
===========ID 0x00008B17: You can hail starships to speak with them. First, target the starship with [SelectTarget], then press and hold [SelectTarget]. This will start an outbound transmission. You cannot hail a hostile starship. 

When initiating a hail, you can choose to trade, engage in piracy, or speak with the pilot. For more information on Piracy, see the "Piracy" entry. 
===========ID 0x00008B1A: You can allocate power to your starship's systems to boost their effects. For instance, allocating more power to lasers makes them recharge faster, while giving power to shields gives you a higher shield capacity. 

Use [Left] and [Right] to select a starship system, and use [Up] and [Down] to give power to it. 

Auto-turrets will automatically fire on enemies as long as the Laser system has power. To disable them, completely power down the Laser system. 

Keep in mind that you have a limited amount of power, and you cannot have all systems at full power. Be sure to experiment with the different systems to find a setup that works best for you. 
===========ID 0x00008B20: The compass displays nearby points of interest and tracked objective markers relative to your location.  

To navigate using the compass, line up a point of interest or objective marker with the gray bar at the top of the watch. This gray bar represents things that are in front of you. Continue to move forward with an objective marker or point of interest lined up with the bar, and you will eventually reach it. Objective and map markers will grow larger on the compass the closer you get to it. 

In addition to showing points of interest and objectives, the compass will also show nearby enemies in relation to your position. Enemies are shown as red dots on your compass.  
===========ID 0x00008B23: Your starship can have up to 3 different weapons. To fire them, press either [WeaponGroup1], [WeaponGroup2], or [WeaponGroup3]. You can fire all of your different weapons at the same time. 

Weapons can have two firing types - Auto and Manual. Auto Turrets rotate and aim independently of a ship's orientation and are fired automatically without a pilot's input. Manual Weapons are fired by the pilot in the direction the ship is facing.

To lock on to an enemy ship, select your target with [Activate] and keep the enemy centered on your screen. When you are fully locked on, the word "Lock" will display on the targeted enemy. An enemy can break your lock by boosting, moving out of range, or maneuvering outside of your targeting systems, so make sure to keep them in your sights! Similarly, when trying to evade attacks, boosting can reduce enemy accuracy and break a missile lock.

Locking onto an enemy ship makes aiming easier, and allows missile weapons to home-in on enemy ships. You can even disable specific parts of enemy ships, like their weapon and shield systems, if you damage them enough. If an enemy ship's system is disabled, they will no longer be able to use it. For example, if you disable a ship's engines, the enemy will not be able to move.

If you have the "Targeting Control Systems" skill unlocked, you can target specific parts of an enemy ship. With this skill unlocked, when you are locked onto a target, you can press [XButton] to target a ship's systems. While targeting systems, use [StrafeLeft] and [StrafeRight] to select a system. Then, simply fire your weapons to damage it. This makes it much easier to strategically disable a ship's systems. 
===========ID 0x00008B26: There are many actions that the people of the Settled Systems will not tolerate:

- Murder or assault of a friendly person

- Trespassing on owned property

- Pickpocketing

- Hacking into owned objects

If you are detected committing any of these crimes, people will immediately become hostile to you. An exception to this rule is thievery. Stealing an owned item will initially result in the item's owner attempting to take the item back from you. If you resist or attempt to steal it again, however, people will become hostile towards you. Additionally, pickpocketing is only a crime if you attempt to steal an item. Looking into a person's Inventory will not result in hostile action against you. Likewise, opening up the hacking minigame is not a crime until you make an attempt. 

Sometimes, guards may give you the option to pay a fine or go to jail. If you cannot afford to pay the fine, you can go to jail or resist arrest. 

Going to jail will result in a loss of XP. However, you cannot lose a level or lose any skills. You and your ship will also be moved to the closest jail.
===========ID 0x00008B29: Not a fan of traveling alone? Recruit a companion to follow you on your travels! Companions can aid you in combat, help carry your items, take part in conversations, and follow orders. 

To talk to your companion, look at them and press [Activate]. You can tell your companion to wait at your current location, or dismiss them as your follower. You don't need to dismiss a companion in order to be sneaky! When sneaking ([Sneak]), your companions will sneak with you so they're harder to detect.

You can trade items with your companions. This is a good way to keep from becoming encumbered.  

Companions also function as crew for your ship. You can assign companions to stations on your ships, which can provide significant buffs to your ship systems. For more information on crew, see the "Crew" entry. 

Companions can gain or lose affinity for you based on your actions. For example, a companion with a strong moral code will greatly dislike it if you murder an innocent settler.
===========ID 0x00008B2C: Crew are people that you can recruit to work for you at your outposts, on your ships, or as followers. Potential crew members can be found throughout the Settled Systems, especially in bars.

You can talk with and hire crew by approaching them and pressing [Activate]. The dialogue menu will show their skills at the top right corner of the screen. All crew have a set of skills that can be beneficial depending on where they are assigned. For example, a crew member with the "Astrodynamics" skill will increase grav jump range and decrease grav jump calculation when they are assigned to work on your ship.

You can use the Crew Roster to view crew members, skills, and assign crew members to ships and outposts. You can also unassign them either through dialogue or through the Crew Roster. To access the Crew Roster, press [DataMenu]. Select the Ship tab on the bottom left of the screen with [Accept] and then press [Crew] to view the roster.

The maximum crew you can have assigned to a ship is dictated by several things. Whichever is the lesser of:

- The combined Crew Capacity on your Reactor, Weapon, Engine and Shield modules.

- The total number of Crew Stations in your cockpit and other modules.

- The number of active Crew members allowed by your Ship Command skill.

You can only assign Crew to landed ships, so you will not be able to assign Crew to your ship if you are flying it. Additionally, you can only assign Crew to outposts that have a Crew Station built at them.  
===========ID 0x00008B2E: Abandoned Outpost
===========ID 0x00008B34: The card reader is not responding.
===========ID 0x00008B38: Guard ships will frequently scan you for contraband. If you fail a scan and guard ships detect contraband on your ship, they may attempt to arrest or attack you. 

If you are carrying contraband in your personal inventory, guards will always catch you. To have a chance at smuggling, you need to place your contraband in a cargo hold with Shielded Cargo capacity. You can view your ship's Shielded Cargo capacity by viewing your Ship Overview in the Ship menu.

There are various ways to further increase the chance of successfully smuggling contraband past guard ship scans:

- Carrying fewer pieces of contraband.

- Installing a Scan Jammer. 

- Having a large amount of Shielded Cargo space compared to the total weight of contraband. The closer your contraband weight is to your ship's Shielded Cargo capacity, the more likely it is to be detected by a scan. 

While Shielded Cargo and Scan Jammers are seldomly for sale, you can find (and even commandeer) ships that already have one or both installed.

===========ID 0x00008B48: You can unlock Skills that will give you permanent benefits. There are 5 categories of Skills:

Combat - These Skills make you more adept at wielding weapons and explosives.

Science - Skills in this category aid in planetary exploration, scanning, building Outposts, and crafting.

Technology - These Skills will increase the effectiveness of high-tech weapons, and also aid in ship building and ship combat.

Physical - Spending Skills in this category can bolster your health/O2, improve your sneaking ability, and increase the damage you deal in melee combat.

Social - Skills in this category are useful for managing crew and companions, completing speech minigames, and getting more bang for your buck at vendors. 

When you level up, you will also gain Skill Points. Skill Points can be used to purchase Skills in the Skills Menu. For more info on the Skills Menu, see the "Data Menu - Skills" entry. 

Every Skill has 4 Ranks. Skills become more powerful with each Rank you unlock. For example, Rank 1 of the "Rejuvenation" Skill lets your health regenerate slowly outside of combat. The final Rank, however, lets you regenerate health quickly while in and outside of combat. Each Rank of a Skill costs one Skill Point to unlock. 

Before you're able to unlock higher Ranks of a Skill, you must first complete its associated Rank Challenge. For example, to be able to unlock Rank 2 of the "Boxing" Skill, you must first kill 20 enemies with unarmed attacks. Once Rank 2 is unlocked, you will have to kill 50 enemies with unarmed attacks to be able to unlock Rank 3, and so on. 

When you make progress on a Skill's Rank Challenge, a popup will appear on screen alerting you of your progress. You can also view your Rank Challenge progress at any time in the Skills Menu.
===========ID 0x00008B4B: In addition to your primary weapon, you can also equip an explosive. 

To equip an explosive, open the Data Menu and select the Inventory section. You can view and equip available explosives in the Equipment tab.  

Press [AltAttack] to throw an explosive. 
===========ID 0x00008B4E: Press [Sneak] to sneak. Sneaking is beneficial in numerous ways, for example:

- Avoiding detection, making pickpocketing and other crimes easier.

Items in the Outgoing container will be transferred to the Incoming container in the other linked outpost, and vice versa. Create output links from modules like extractors to the Outgoing container to automatically transport harvested resources to the other outpost. Create an output link from the Incoming container to modules, like storage, to automatically store or use transported items.  

There are two types of Cargo Links: 

- Basic - allows links within the same system

- Advanced - allows links between systems
===========ID 0x00008BE3: Your Oxygen Supply (O2) is a resource that is depleted by certain actions. For example:

- Performing power attacks

- Sprinting and running while encumbered

Your O2 is displayed as a white bar on your watch. When you perform an action that uses O2, this white bar will deplete. Your O2 will recharge as long as you don't perform actions that deplete it. 

If you continue to perform actions that use O2 while it's depleted, you will gain CO2. CO2 is shown as a red bar on your watch. If CO2 completely fills the O2/CO2 meter on your watch, you will lose health when you perform actions that deplete O2 (like power attacks). If you let your O2 recharge, it will replace your CO2. 
===========ID 0x00008BE6: You can choose a character background and up to three traits when creating your character. 

Backgrounds provide multiple skills for you to start with. You can choose any background that is most desirable to you and your playstyle. 

Traits offer both negative and positive effects. For example, the Alien DNA trait grants you more health overall, but healing items are less effective. Traits are completely optional and not required. 

You can remove many equipped traits surgically at Reliant Medical surgery centers. Other traits can be removed through unique gameplay scenarios. Make sure you really want to do this - when you remove a trait, you can't get it back!
===========ID 0x00008BE8: Kreet Crawler
===========ID 0x00008BEB: There are 3 different types of damage your starship can sustain: 

- EM Damage - a special type of damage that reduces power for a period of time. EM damage cannot be repaired - you must wait for the effect to expire. 

- System Damage - this type of damage reduces the max power for your starship systems, and can eventually disable a system entirely.  To repair a system, give power to it. After a bit of time, the damaged power slots will come back online. 

- Hull Damage - any damage that is not absorbed by your shields is taken as hull damage. If your hull integrity reaches 0, your ship will explode, resulting in death. You can visit a Ship Services Technician to repair your ship. Alternatively, you can stock up on Ship Parts, which are items that take up cargo space. Using these will restore some of your hull integrity. You can use Ship Parts while in the Ship Menu, or you can press [RepairShip] to repair your ship on the fly.

- Novice locks - require no hacking skill.

- Advanced locks - require Security rank 1.

- Expert locks - require Security rank 2. 

- Master locks - require Security rank 3. 

To successfully hack a lock, you must match the provided keys within the slots on the rings that appear on the Digipick. Successfully filling out a ring on the Digipick using the keys will cause the ring to disappear. Once all the rings disappear, the lock will successfully open. 

Failing to unlock a lock or exiting the minigame before it's fully complete will result in the loss of a Digipick. 

You can use auto-attempts to show you the correct key that fits the current ring. Successfully hacking a lock will award you with an auto-attempt point. You can store multiple auto-attempt points depending on your Security skill rank.

===========ID 0x00008E17: When faced with a locked door or container, you can attempt to pick the lock.

Locks range in difficulty: novice, advanced, expert, and master. Picking locks above novice difficulty requires ranks of the "Locksmith" perk.

To pick a lock, you must have at least one bobby pin in your inventory. Bobby pins can be purchased or found throughout the Commonwealth. Once you have a bobby pin, look at the locked door or container you want to pick and press [Activate]. 

To pick the lock, use [RotatePick] to rotate the bobby pin, then [RotateLock] to rotate the screwdriver. 

If the lock resists, release [RotateLock] and reposition the bobby pin before trying again. The closer the bobby pin is to the correct position, the further the lock will rotate before you either encounter resistance or the bobby pin breaks. 

When the bobby pin is in the correct position, the lock will fully rotate and open. More difficult locks require more precise placement of the bobby pin.

Press [Cancel] to exit lockpicking.

Some locks require a key or cannot be opened through lockpicking. "Inaccessible" locks typically require a terminal or a different outside source to access.

Locks that are owned display red unlock text. Picking a lock on an owned door or container is a crime. If you are detected, nearby onlookers will become hostile to you.

Your chance to hit a specific target or limb will be displayed as a number on the highlighted enemy. The current condition of a given limb is displayed as a small bar below the chance to hit. Do enough damage to a given limb and it will become crippled (see the "Limb Damage" entry for the effects of crippling).

To mark a target for attack, press [Pick]. To cycle between limbs, use [LeftStick]. You will only be able to mark targets within your weapon's range, so if you're using a melee weapon, you'll have to close with your enemy before entering V.A.T.S.

The number of targets you can mark is limited by your Action Points. By improving your Agility attribute, you can increase the number of targets you can mark at one time. You can unmark a target with [Cancel].

===========ID 0x00008E3C: Terminals containing useful information will often be locked with a password. Hack them to access their contents.

Locked terminals range in difficulty: novice, advanced, expert, and master. Unlocking terminals above novice difficulty requires ranks of the "Hacker" perk.

To hack a terminal, approach it and press [Activate]. The terminal will display a list of potential passwords and random characters. Only one word listed is the correct password. 

Use the mouse to highlight a word. Press [Click] to attempt to use that word as the password.

If the selection is correct, the terminal will unlock. 

If the selection is wrong, "Entry denied" and a "Likeness" number will be displayed in the corner of the terminal screen.

The Likeness number tells you how many letters in your attempted password match exactly (both letter and position) to the actual password. Use this information to narrow your search by comparing the letters of your attempted password to the remaining options.

As you move your cursor through the lists of characters, you may find a group that highlights. Selecting these and pressing [Click] may remove a dud word or reset your number of attempts.

You have four attempts to select the right password. If you fail to find the correct entry after four attempts, you'll be locked out of the terminal for 10 seconds.

You can press [Cancel] at any time to exit the terminal.

Terminals that are owned display red unlock text. Hacking an owned terminal is a crime. If you are detected, nearby  onlookers will become hostile to you.

===========ID 0x00008E4F: <Alias=MessageTextReplaceActor> is available to be your follower.
===========ID 0x00008E54: DESIGNER NOTE: At this point there would be a misc point to Commander Tuala, but those don't display onscreen currently, so just go over and speak to him.
===========ID 0x00008E55: DESIGNER NOTE: At this point, you'd hear a distinctive repeating "blip" in the distance.
===========ID 0x00008E56: DESIGNER NOTE: There's a bug currently the quest target here. It should be pointing you towards the NAT, not back through the elevator behind you. Please walk straight ahead to proceed
===========ID 0x00008E59: Developed for the Apollo mission to reach Earth's Moon, the F-1 engine was a single-nozzle, liquid-fueled rocket engine that could generate over 6 million newtons of thrust each. Five of these would be used in the Saturn V super heavy-lift launch vehicle.

===========ID 0x00008E68: DESIGNER NOTE: At this point, the player would take the NAT down to the spaceport, but that's not hooked up currently, so you'll just need to teleport. Refer to the steps in the playtest walkthrough or use the following console command: player.moveto NA_NAT_SpaceportMarkerRef
===========ID 0x00008E6B: Lopez Satellite
===========ID 0x00008E6C: DESIGNER NOTE: When the player looks into this window, he'll watch as a Heatleech approaches the blossoming Lazarus Plant and transforms into a fully mature Terrormorph and then runs off. 

For now, I'm just turning on the morph, then teleporting it up to the combat area.
===========ID 0x00008E6D: DESIGNER NOTE: Normally, there'd be a Speech Challenge at this point to convince Hadrian and Jakob to keep things secret, but there's a bad bug with Speech Challenges currently, so for now, we'll just say you passed.
===========ID 0x00008E73: DESIGNER NOTE: Real estate system isn't yet hooked up. Once that's in, this objective will only complete once the player's acquired their beautiful penthouse.

Select the ship you want to dock with using [SelectTarget]. If you see an option that says "Dock," press and hold [XButton] to dock with the ship. 

It's possible to dock and board a hostile ship, but you must disable its engines first. You also will not be able to board an enemy ship if there are other enemies engaging you.

In Build Mode, use [LShoulder] and [RShoulder] to choose the category of what you want to build. You must have all of the necessary materials to build a module.

While sneaking, approach a character and press [Activate] to look at a character's Inventory. While looking at their Inventory, press [Accept] on an item to pickpocket it. 

Looking at a character's Inventory is not a crime. On the other hand, an unsuccessful pickpocket will result in immediate hostility towards you. 

Your chance of success is displayed on the item you wish to pickpocket, and is shown both by percentage and by color. Colors range from Blue (Very Easy) to Green, Yellow, Red, and Gray (Impossible). You can increase your chances of a successful pickpocket by remaining undetected while doing so. For information on stealth and sneaking, see the "Stealth" entry.

You can make progress on research projects by contributing resources to them over time. You do not need to have all of the required resources in your inventory at once.

Your research progress is saved after you step away from a Research Lab. You can pick up right where you left off from any other Research Lab that you encounter.

You can keep track of the resources you need for research projects by using the "Track Project" function. At a Research Lab, simply select a project, and press [XButton]. Doing this will keep track of all of the resources you need to complete the project. If you come across a tracked resource while exploring, it will show a blue magnifying glass next to its name.

SUDDEN DEVELOPMENTS
There is a chance that a Sudden Development will occur when researching. A Sudden Development will reduce the number of resources needed to complete the project.

UNLOCKING NEW PROJECTS
Completing research projects can make new projects available. Projects that will become available after completing the currently selected project are displayed in the "Research Tree" section of the "Research Projects" screen.

If you exit the transaction, all items in the "Buy Back" category will be moved to the merchant's regular inventory, and you will not be able to repurchase the items for the same price you've sold them for. 

Unlocking the "Commerce" skill from the "Social" skill tree decreases the price of goods at vendors, while increasing the credits you receive for sales. 
===========ID 0x00008EAC: DESIGNER NOTE: The path in front of you will be blocked by a laser grid in the future, with a bright red box positioned next to it. Perhaps you can do something with it?

===========ID 0x00009E9C: Wayfarer, wanderer, seeker... transient. You've been called many things during your travels, and learned something those others could never understand - the journey IS the destination.
===========ID 0x00009E9E: Masterless and unbound, you wandered the Settled Systems as a blade for hire. To some, you were a simple mercenary. To others, a hero. And to a select few... a nightmare they could never wake from.
===========ID 0x00009EA0: Let those other hotheaded pilots obsess over laser weapons and maneuverability. You're a space trucker, pure and simple. Pack the cargo, get it there fast, get paid, repeat. Life is simple and good.
===========ID 0x00009EA2: From the Ashta of Akila to the Terrormorphs that plague the whole of the Settled Systems, hostile alien life abounds. You've learned the skills to track them, find them, and take them down.
===========ID 0x00009EA4: Channel zero-point energy, becoming as immutable stone.
===========ID 0x00009EA6: You were always disgusted by suckers killing themselves to make an "honest wage." As soon as you were old enough to hold a weapon, you took what you wanted from anyone unlucky enough to have it.
===========ID 0x00009EA8: They said exploration is a lost art. You didn't listen. As the major factions argued over the space they desperately tried to control, you were busy uncovering the wonders of the Settled Systems.
===========ID 0x00009EAA: There was a time when all you wanted to be was a titan of industry, maybe a ship designer, or megacorp exec. Thankfully, that skillset never goes out of style in the Settled Systems.
===========ID 0x00009EAC: The wars are over. Peace now reigns the Settled Systems. But only because there are those quietly fighting to keep it. Because of you, agreements were signed, words were heeded... lives were spared.
===========ID 0x00009EAE: Robots? Mere toys. Neuroamps? Good for parlor tricks. The Colony War may have made implants and upgrades available to veterans, but you once saw a greater future. Humans and machines, as one. 
===========ID 0x00009EB0: From Neon to New Atlantis, the megacorps stand as monuments to power, prestige and profit. You've worked both for and against them, on the inside and out, often sacrificing conscience for credits.
===========ID 0x00009EB2: Leave it to human beings to fight over something as infinite as outer space. That's where you come in. You've never been afraid to take on the enemy... but you'd much rather take care of your friends.

===========ID 0x00009EB8: Wherever there are wanted individuals, there are those who profit from their capture. And your quarry knows that in the vastness of space, they can run... but they can't hide.
===========ID 0x00009EBA: You've worked the line at the toughest clubs in the Settled Systems. Back then, you learned that most non-lethal confrontations can be solved one of two ways: a strong right hook, or a more strongly secured door.

===========ID 0x00009EEC: You grew up worshiping the Great Serpent. Grav jumping provides a temporary boost to health and oxygen, but health and oxygen are lowered if you don't continue jumping regularly - like an addiction. (Can't be combined with any other religion trait.)

===========ID 0x00009EF9: You're a people person. Exerting yourself uses less oxygen when adventuring with human companions, but more when adventuring alone. (Can't be combined with Introvert.)
===========ID 0x00009EFB: You really need your alone time. Exerting yourself uses less oxygen when adventuring alone, but more when adventuring with other human companions. (Can't be combined with Extrovert.)
===========ID 0x00009EFD: With your knowledge of anatomy and skilled, steady hands, you could have had a lucrative career as a surgeon. Instead, you followed your heart, and created works of art to amaze and inspire.
===========ID 0x00009F00: Someone put a price on your head, and word has spread. Occasionally, armed mercenaries will show up and try to kill you, but being cornered gives you an edge - when your health is low, you do extra damage.
===========ID 0x00009F02: Your parents are alive and well, and you can visit them at their home. But you will automatically send 2% of your credits home to them every week.
===========ID 0x00009F04: You own a luxurious, customizable house on a peaceful planet! Unfortunately it comes with a 125,000 credit mortgage with GalBank that has to be paid weekly.
===========ID 0x00009F06: Occasionally, if you have crew trained in a certain ship system, that system will automatically repair itself to full health whenever it is damaged below 50%. However, all crew cost twice as much to hire.
===========ID 0x00009F08: You've never acclimated to space. Health and oxygen are increased when on the surface, but decreased when you're in space. (Can't be combined with Spaced.)
===========ID 0x00009F0A: Your body has become acclimated to space. Health and oxygen are increased when in space, but decreased when on the surface. (Can't be combined with Terra Firma.)
===========ID 0x00009F0C: The discovery of the Settled Systems' many oxygen-rich planets and moons meant humans could live just about anywhere... if they had the know how. You did, and utilized it to great effect.
===========ID 0x00009F0E: The Settled Systems is home to untold alien species. And while none of them have yet proven sentient, that never deterred you. So you sought out and studied them for whatever gifts they offered.
===========ID 0x00009F10: Good? Bad? Whose right is it to say? If there's anything you've learned while traipsing through the galaxy, it's this: space may look black, but it's really one big shade of grey.
===========ID 0x00009F12: The Settled Systems is no stranger to warfare, and if there's one thing armed conflict relies on it's trained warriors with guns and guts. You had both. Simple, bloody work... and you were great at it.

===========ID 0x0002D1B1: I've agreed to speak to the UC Cabinet with Hadrian. She said I can meet her outside MAST in New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D1B2: Hadrian wants to speak privately to Percival and I about Percival's findings. I should follow her.
===========ID 0x0002D1B3: Percival analyzed the sample and confirmed Hadrian's suspicion - it's just like the one from Londinion - a city destroyed by Terrormorphs. Now we just need to make our way back to "The Sixth Circle" to speak with Hadrian.
===========ID 0x0002D1B4: I gave Percival the Terrormorph sample. He asked me to follow him inside so he can take a look at it.
===========ID 0x0002D1B5: Lou says I can find Percival in the old Red Devils Headquarters. He gave me a key that will allow me to get through the Deep Mines to reach it.
===========ID 0x0002D1B6: I've dealt with the Heatleeches that were draining the power to the drill's exit. Time to find Percival.
===========ID 0x0002D1B7: Something seems to be draining juice out of this door's junction box. I'll need to clear that before I can proceed.
===========ID 0x0002D1B8: I did it! I've cleared Percival's debt. Now I should be able to get his location from Lou at "The Sixth Circle."
===========ID 0x0002D1B9: It sounds like this research has some real potential. Cambridge said I should speak to Oktai Enbayar at the Trade Authority office and ask him for a trade - this formula for clearing Percival's debt.
===========ID 0x0002D1BA: Time to return this research to Cambridge back at "The Sixth Circle."
===========ID 0x0002D1BB: Cambridge has informed me there's a faster way out of the mines - the elevator in this room. He says there should be a key stashed away in the Thresher room.
===========ID 0x0002D1BC: I've collected Percival and Cambridge's research. I should phone up to Cambridge to see what he wants me to do with it.
===========ID 0x0002D1BD: Analysis complete! Now I just need to collect the research from the Thresher.
===========ID 0x0002D1BE: The Thresher's sequence has started. Now I just to wait for it to complete.
===========ID 0x0002D1BF: I've placed the Hematite in the Thresher. Now I just need to let it do its thing and collect the results.
===========ID 0x0002D1C0: Hematite acquired. Now I just need to deposit it in the Thresher.
===========ID 0x0002D1C1: I need to collect a sample of Aqueous Hematite to finish the research. Cambridge said there should be some near the entrance to this shaft.
===========ID 0x0002D1C2: I've put down the Spacers' leader in the Deep Mines. Now to phone up to Cambridge so I can finish his research.
===========ID 0x0002D1C3: I collected Lou's credits. Now I can pay off Percival's debt!
===========ID 0x0002D1C4: I adjusted Percival's debt amount to something more reasonable. Now to collect those credits from Lou.
===========ID 0x0002D1C5: I've got three options to clear Percival's debt: pay it myself, break into the Trade Authority to reduce the amount, or clear out the Deep Mines and collect some research for Cambridge.
===========ID 0x0002D1C6: Lou will only tell me where Percival is if I clear Percival's debt first. But it also seems someone else in the bar wants my attention.
===========ID 0x0002D1C7: The bartender at The Sixth Circle was intrigued by me asking after Walker. Maybe he knows something. I should talk to him.
===========ID 0x0002D1C8: Turns out Percival no longer works for the Trade Authority. In fact, he owes them money. Oktai Enbayar suggested someone in "The Sixth Circle" bar may know where he's hiding.
===========ID 0x0002D1C9: Hadrian has asked me to find her colleague, Percival Walker, on Mars. Percival was recently working with the Trade Authority there, so that seems like a natural place to check first.
===========ID 0x0002D1D5: Kelton analyzed the findings and found that he was right - there's something wrong with the tree, and the consequences could be disastrous. I should check in with him later after he brings up his findings to MAST.
===========ID 0x0002D1D6: I've delivered the sensors to Kelton, and need to wait while he analyzes the data.
===========ID 0x0002D1D7: I've found all of the sensors Kelton asked me to acquire. I need to deliver them to him.
===========ID 0x0002D1D8: A scientist in New Atlantis named Kelton Frush has asked me to assist him in his research. I need to collect sensors scattered around the city and bring them to him so he can analyze their recordings.

===========ID 0x0002D1EC: I need to deal with a <Alias=Operative>. I can find them at <Alias=ChosenLocation> orbiting <Alias=ChosenLocation_Planet> in the <Alias=ChosenLocation_System> System.
===========ID 0x0002D1ED: I need to deal with a <Alias=Operative>. I can find them in <Alias=ChosenLocation> on <Alias=ChosenLocation_Planet> in the <Alias=ChosenLocation_System> System.
===========ID 0x0002D1EE: I should speak to <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> to find out what my next assignment is.
===========ID 0x0002D1F5: I got some less-than legitimate equipment off some bad people for Denis so that he can refurbish and sell it. At least he pays well.
===========ID 0x0002D1F6: I should have enough equipment for Denis. Time to pay him a visit and get paid.
===========ID 0x0002D1F7: I've found where my targets are holing up. I now need to find that equipment and take it for Denis.
===========ID 0x0002D1F8: Denis has asked me to acquire some equipment from some dangerous people through not entirely legitimate means. I already have enough of what he wants, so I can go get more if I want to.
===========ID 0x0002D1F9: Denis has asked me to acquire some equipment from some dangerous people through not entirely legitimate means. He gave me their location.
===========ID 0x0002D21C: I've chosen to bring Kryx's Legacy to Delgado and the Crimson Fleet, and help them fend off UC SysDef's impending attack.
===========ID 0x0002D21D: I've chosen to bring Kryx's Legacy to UC SysDef, and help them end the Crimson Fleet's threat to the Settled Systems.
===========ID 0x0002D21E: I've safely detached from the Legacy just as the old transport was torn apart. I should now jump back to the Key and help the Crimson Fleet fend off the impending UC SysDef attack.
===========ID 0x0002D21F: I've safely detached from the Legacy just as the old transport was torn apart. I now need to decide where to bring Kryx's Legacy. Should I return it to Delgado on the Key, or turn it in to UC SysDef? The choice is mine alone to make.
===========ID 0x0002D220: With the power diverted away from the Legacy's shielding, it's being battered by Bannoc IV's EM field. The damage is taking its toll on the transport, and I should return to the safety of my own ship as soon as possible.
===========ID 0x0002D221: I've successfully downloaded the currency from the Legacy's Vault onto my Data Core. Kryx's Legacy is mine.
===========ID 0x0002D222: After listening to Kryx's final log, I've learned that I'll need to reroute the jury-rigged power from the Legacy's shields to the Vault in order to gain access to the ship's currency, which will make the transport vulnerable to Bannoc IV's EM Field.
===========ID 0x0002D223: After arriving at the Legacy's Vault Control Center, I've encountered the remains of who I believe to be the great Jasper Kryx. I should investigate the corpse and recover any information that I can.
===========ID 0x0002D224: I now have access to the Legacy's Vault.
===========ID 0x0002D225: In order to access the Legacy's Vault, I'll need to obtain a Transfer Module. A member of the crew was likely carrying one of these devices.
===========ID 0x0002D226: I've boarded the GalBank Transport "Legacy." My ultimate goal is to reach the Vault Control Center, from which I should be able to access all of the ship's currency.
===========ID 0x0002D227: I've arrived at Bannoc IV and the ComSpike has locked onto the GalBank Transport "Legacy." I should dock and board the derelict ship and begin the hunt for Kryx's Legacy.
===========ID 0x0002D228: I've arrived at the Vigilance. I should speak to Commander Ikande immediately.
===========ID 0x0002D229: I now have the proper modules installed on my ship to penetrate the EM field surrounding Bannoc IV. I should proceed to Bannoc IV immediately.
===========ID 0x0002D22A: I now have the proper modules installed on my ship to penetrate the EM field surrounding Bannoc IV. Before I proceed to Bannoc IV, I should report my progress to Commander Ikande at the Vigilance.
===========ID 0x0002D22B: I've been informed that UC SysDef is massing for an attack on the Key. In order to obtain the money to secure enough reinforcements to hold SysDef off, I'm to continue to Bannoc IV and retrieve Kryx's Legacy.
===========ID 0x0002D22C: After bringing the Conduction Grid data back to the Key, Naeva Mora has informed me that the Crimson Fleet is on high alert and Delgado wants to see me right away.
===========ID 0x0002D231: I handed over the samples to Percival and got my payment. If I'm looking to collect more, I'm sure he'd be willing to get me the specifics.
===========ID 0x0002D232: Samples collected. Now I just need to return them to Percival at TMD HQ on Mars.
===========ID 0x0002D233: I've got my targets. Time to head to <Alias=PlanetLocation> and harvest those samples.
===========ID 0x0002D238: I have successfully delivered research samples to the Clinic.
===========ID 0x0002D239: Dr. Darvish has asked me to collect research samples for the Clinic. I need to bring her <Global=FFClinicR02ItemTotal> <Alias=ResourceAlias> samples.
===========ID 0x0002D23C: I successfully delivered medical data on behalf of the Clinic.
===========ID 0x0002D23D: I've been asked to deliver a slate of medical research data on behalf of The Clinic.
===========ID 0x0002D257: Kryx's Legacy and the Key are in the hands of UC SysDef, and the Crimson Fleet have been all but eliminated, which should render the Settled Systems safer for years to come.
===========ID 0x0002D258: The lockdown on the Key has been lifted. I should now return to the Vigilance and speak with Commander Ikande.
===========ID 0x0002D259: I've deactivated the bomb implanted in Shinya Voss' chest.
===========ID 0x0002D25A: All of the reactors have been overridden and Delgado has been killed. I should now retrieve his passcode and end the lockdown on the Key.
===========ID 0x0002D25B: Delgado is overloading the Key's reactors in order to destroy the station! The only way to prevent this from occurring is by overriding the reactors one-by-one and staying alive in the process.
===========ID 0x0002D25C: I'm now face-to-face with Delgado. I should convince him to surrender or kill him if he refuses to comply.
===========ID 0x0002D25D: I've agreed to let Shinya Voss live by disabling the now active bomb that's implanted in his body. I'll need to locate Delgado's computer in order to override the detonation.
===========ID 0x0002D25E: As I passed through the Reckoner's Core, I've come across Shinya Voss, the Crimson Fleet's Reckoner. I should see why he wants to speak with me instead of attacking me on sight.
===========ID 0x0002D25F: The only way to reach Delgado is through the Last Nova. I need to find a way to get through the bar's heavy security doors.
===========ID 0x0002D260: Security doors are preventing me from reaching the internal areas of the Key. I need to find a way to bypass this obstacle.
===========ID 0x0002D261: I am now aboard the Key. I need to fight my way to the Operations Center to confront Delgado for his crimes.
===========ID 0x0002D262: The Vigilance has arrived at the Key and all of the Crimson Fleet's ships have been destroyed. I should now board the Key and attempt to take Delgado into custody, or kill him if he refuses to comply.
===========ID 0x0002D263: All of the Key's Defensive Batteries have been disabled. I should now support the rest of the UC SysDef fleet at the Key until the Vigilance arrives for the final assault.
===========ID 0x0002D264: Commander Ikande has informed me that the Vigilance is preparing to attack the Key with an all-out assault. In order to keep the flagship safe, I should jump ahead and disable the Key's Defensive Batteries.
===========ID 0x0002D265: All of the Crimson Fleet ships attacking the Vigilance have been destroyed. I should now dock with the Vigilance and hand over Kryx's Legacy.
===========ID 0x0002D266: After I decided to bring Kryx's Legacy to UC SysDef, the Crimson Fleet has launched an attack on the Vigilance. I've been ordered to secure the area by destroying the pirates' ships.
===========ID 0x0002D2CF: I told Elias Cartwright I didn't find Sahar Hasanov's will. I get the feeling he'll try to find other ways of getting Frank Langston out of the Core, but I'm not sure how much luck he'll have.
===========ID 0x0002D2D0: I gave Sahar Hasanov's Last Will and Testament to Elias Cartwright. He was overjoyed. I can't tell if he's more happy at doing right by the Hasanov's or sticking it to Frank Langston.
===========ID 0x0002D2D1: Frank Langston paid me a fortune to hand over Sahar Hasanov's Will. Now I just need to lie to Elias Cartwright about not having found it and this whole business is over.
===========ID 0x0002D2D2: I found Sahar Hasanov's Last Will and Testament and it revealed there was one Hasanov left: Blake Aldwell. I was hired to deliver this to Elias Cartwright, but Frank Langston may be interested in this Will, as well.
===========ID 0x0002D2D3: Elias Cartwright has hired me to go to old Sahar's Farm located elsewhere on Akila. Sahar died over 40 years ago when Ashta attacked the farm, and there most certainly will be Ashta there now.
===========ID 0x0002D2D4: Elias Cartwright is really upset that Frank Langston is living in the historic Core district. He's offered me a job.
===========ID 0x0002D2D5: A guard mentioned that Mayor Cartwright might have work, if I'm interested.
===========ID 0x0002D2DF: I should talk to Theresa about what happened with the thieves.
===========ID 0x0002D2E0: I took care of the thieves and stopped the robbery. I should report back to Theresa.
===========ID 0x0002D2E1: Officer Endler's on his way to make sure the thieves don't try anything. I should  tell Theresa about this.
===========ID 0x0002D2E2: I found Officer Endler at the UC Security office in the Well. He said he'll head over to check for the thieves right away.
===========ID 0x0002D2E3: The thieves heard I was trying to stop them and attacked me. I should get rid of them before they do the same to me.
===========ID 0x0002D2E4: I can stop the robbery myself. I need to take care of the thieves before they have a chance to rob the UC Surplus.
===========ID 0x0002D2E5: Theresa asked me to report the robbery to Officer Karson Endler at UC Security in the Well. I should head to the office right away. 
===========ID 0x0002D2E6: Those two men are definitely planning to rob the UC Surplus. I should report what I've learned back to Theresa at Kay's House.
===========ID 0x0002D2E7: I found the thieves outside the UC Surplus. I should listen in and see if I can figure out what they're planning.
===========ID 0x0002D2E8: Theresa asked me to find the thieves and see if I can figure out what they're planning. I should go to the UC Surplus and listen in on their conversation.
===========ID 0x0002D2E9: Theresa Mason suspects that some of her customers might be planning to rob the UC Surplus. I should talk to her and find out what I can do to help.
===========ID 0x0002D2ED: I delivered the art to Solomon. Note to self: shady art dealer types probably aren't the safest people to become friends with.
===========ID 0x0002D2EE: I got the art from Zoe Kaminski. I need to deliver it to Samson.
===========ID 0x0002D2EF: Samson Cebrail has asked me to pick up some artwork from Zoe Kaminski at the Trade Authority. 
===========ID 0x0002D2FE: Instead of sabotaging Henry Filburn's beer, I warned him instead. He was furious and is going to make sure Sarah can't interfere with him again. He also gave me a reward.
===========ID 0x0002D2FF: Sarah Filburn's sabotage of Henry Filburn's brewing operation was successful. In time, it should force Henry to focus more on the IntelliWheat side of the business.
===========ID 0x0002D300: It turns out that upping the alcohol content of the new batch of Henry Filburn's beer made his beer more popular than ever. Sarah wanted to pay me to sabotage the beer, so there's no way I'll get a reward now.
===========ID 0x0002D301: Henry Filburn's new batch of beer has gone over terribly. Just as planned. I should tell Sarah Filburn the good news and get paid.
===========ID 0x0002D302: Henry Filburn's latest batch of beer is done brewing. I should go to the Stoneroot Inn and see how the patrons like my "improvements."
===========ID 0x0002D303: I've tampered with Henry Filburn's latest batch of beer. Now I have to wait for it to finish brewing. It shouldn't take more than a day.
===========ID 0x0002D304: Sarah Filburn wants me to sabotage her brother-in-law's latest batch of beer so that he's forced to work on IntelliWheat, instead. I have to go to Henry Filburn's brewing operation and figure out how to do that.
===========ID 0x0002D305: A guard said that Sarah Filburn was arguing with her brother Henry about something. Might be worth investigating.
===========ID 0x0002D36C: Manaia Adams is looking for someone "discreet" to help her. Might be worth looking into.
===========ID 0x0002D36F: Katherine Luzion believes her husband may have been murdered. But Neon Security shows no interest in investigating it. At all.
===========ID 0x0002D372: Someone named Clover at CeltCorp needs help. The Security guard really didn't catch more than that.
===========ID 0x0002D375: Apparently Frank Renick's robot got vandalized - and Neon Security certainly isn't going to do anything about it.
===========ID 0x0002D378: Reliant Medical has some sort of shortage. Doc Manning might need some help with that.
===========ID 0x0002D37B: Apparently Saburo Okadigbo has run afoul of Neon Security. Who knows why?
===========ID 0x0002D37E: A Neon Security guard mentioned that a DJ, BorealUS, may need some help.
===========ID 0x0002D382: Sergeant Yumi is looking for people to help New Atlantis Security. The guard I talked to thinks I should contact him.
===========ID 0x0002D385: The bartender at the Viewport apparently lost something and New Atlantis Security isn't helping her. Perhaps I can.
===========ID 0x0002D388: There's a strange scientist staring at a tree in New Atlantis. Security is worried about him.
===========ID 0x0002D38B: MAST sent someone to the Well to help with the brown-outs. But nothing's changed. New Atlantis security hopes someone can resolve it.
===========ID 0x0002D39A: I provided the <Alias.PluralName=QuestGiver> with the scan data that I captured.
===========ID 0x0002D39B: The <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> is dead.
===========ID 0x0002D39C: I've completed the geological scans requested by the <Alias.PluralName=QuestGiver>. I should return to them to provide them with the data.
===========ID 0x0002D39D: <Alias.PluralName=QuestGiver> on <Alias=Planet> are in need of scan data of nearby geological features.
===========ID 0x0002D3AD: With the <Alias.CurrentName=Boss> eliminated, the <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> rewarded me with my share of the bounty.
===========ID 0x0002D3AE: The <Alias.CurrentName=Boss> has been killed. I should speak to the <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> about my share of the bounty.
===========ID 0x0002D3AF: The <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> is dead.
===========ID 0x0002D3B0: I've begun an assault on the <Alias=DungeonLocation> alongside the <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> in order to claim the bounty on the <Alias.CurrentName=Boss>.
===========ID 0x0002D3B1: A <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> on <Alias=Planet> has asked me to help <Alias.PronounPosObj=QuestGiver> track down and eliminate a <Alias.CurrentName=Boss> with a bounty on their head. The <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> handed me the coordinates to the location where we will stage an assault on their hideout.
===========ID 0x0002D3CA: I placed a tracking sensor at the top of the old Mars launchpad tower. Hopefully, it helps the Tracker Agent find her lost quarry.
===========ID 0x0002D3CB: I climbed the old Mars launchpad tower and placed the sensor at the top. I should return to the Tracker Agent.
===========ID 0x0002D3CC: The Tracker Agent wants me to help put a sensor at the top of the old Mars launchpad tower to help her track down one of her lost bounties.
===========ID 0x0002D3D6: A patron at the Astral Lounge, Manaia Adams, has asked me to pick up a piece of merchandise and sell it to a vendor. I found the item at a warehouse, sold it to Kolman Lang, and returned to Manaia for my reward.
===========ID 0x0002D3D7: A patron at the Astral Lounge, Manaia Adams, has asked me to pick up a piece of merchandise and sell it to a vendor. I picked up the item and sold it to Kolman Lang at the Trade Authority.
===========ID 0x0002D3D8: A patron at the Astral Lounge, Manaia Adams, has asked me to pick up a piece of merchandise and sell it to a vendor. I went to the warehouse behind Neon Tactical and retrieved the item.
===========ID 0x0002D3D9: A patron at the Astral Lounge, Manaia Adams, has asked me to pick up a piece of merchandise and sell it to a vendor. I should head to the warehouse behind Neon Tactical and find the item.
===========ID 0x0002D3DC: I gave Gladys her Velocity. I wonder what she'll think of it. 
===========ID 0x0002D3DD: Gladys Coffin wants me to get her a Velocity from Madam Sauvage in Neon. She doesn't care which variety. 
===========ID 0x0002D3E7: I survived the Red Mile! But should I maybe press my luck and try again sometime? I currently sit at <Global=PlayerCompletedRedMile> successful runs.
===========ID 0x0002D3E8: I've successfully completed the Red Mile! I should return to Mei for my prize.
===========ID 0x0002D3E9: It's time to run the Red Mile. After taking the elevator down, I need to get to the end and hit the beacon, assuming I survive.
===========ID 0x0002D3EA: I've signed up to run the Red Mile. Mei Divine is making an announcement about it. When she finishes, I can start my run.
===========ID 0x0002D3F9: I went all over Akila City helping out the Low House for Amira Wolf. Hopefully it did some good for the less fortunate folk in the Stretch.
===========ID 0x0002D3FA: Amira Wolf has given me one last task, more of a thank you. I'm to deliver some wheat to Simone Jansen and her family.
===========ID 0x0002D3FB: I've handled getting donations for the Low House. It's time to report back to Amira Wolf.
===========ID 0x0002D3FC: Amira Wolf and the Low House needs more donations. She's asked me to talk to two reliable benefactors: Elias Cartwright and Reisha Lance. She also wants me to try and get the Trade Authority to start donating. So I should talk with Duncan Lynch.
===========ID 0x0002D3FD: The Farming Computer has been rebooted. The Filburns should be able to harvest IntelliWheat now. I should return to Amira Wolf and give her the good news.
===========ID 0x0002D3FE: The Low House's IntelliWheat shipment has been delayed because the farming equipment needs to be manually rebooted. But the farms are outside the Akila City walls. I volunteered to brave the dangerous Ashta and get the job done.
===========ID 0x0002D3FF: The Low House feeds and provides for the basic needs of the unfortunates in the Stretch. But the latest IntelliWheat shipment is late. Amira Wolf has asked me to ask Sarah Filburn what's the status, and help if I need to.
===========ID 0x0002D400: Some guard mentioned that a certain Amira Wolf of the Low House could use some help. Might be worth investigating.
===========ID 0x0002D426: Sarah and I have spoken about our relationship and agreed we both share a strong, romantic bond between us.
===========ID 0x0002D427: Sarah and I have spoken about our relationship and decided it would be best if we remained as best friends.
===========ID 0x0002D428: After speaking with Sarah at the Colony War Memorial in New Atlantis, she's suggested we speak about something of a more personal nature near the waterfall in New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D429: After speaking with Admiral Logan, Sarah's requested to visit the Colony War Memorial in New Atlantis. I should proceed with her there as soon as I can.
===========ID 0x0002D42A: After speaking with Sarah, we've decided to return to New Atlantis and close the chapter on the fate of the UC Dauntless's crew by speaking once again to Admiral Logan.
===========ID 0x0002D42B: I've decided that Sona should return back to Jemison with us. I should now speak to Sarah before we return to New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D42C: I've decided that Sona should be allowed to stay on her world and promised we should return to her home and visit from time-to-time. I should now speak to Sarah before we return to New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D42D: Upon returning from the gravesite, I've found Sarah and Sona at an impasse. Sona wants to remain behind on her world, while Sarah wishes to bring her back to New Atlantis. I'll have to decide which option to choose.
===========ID 0x0002D42E: After a short discussion, Sarah has decided to remain with Sona while I retrieve the UC Dauntless's crew's genetags from their makeshift graves. We intend to bring the genetags back to MAST to close the book on these lost soldier's lives.
===========ID 0x0002D42F: The young girl has turned out to be Sona, the daughter of two of the UC Dauntless's crew who had her while being marooned on this world. Sona's told us that all of the crew, including her parents, died and were buried nearby.
===========ID 0x0002D430: While investigating the UC Dauntless's crew crash site, Sarah and I have stumbled upon a young girl wearing an old UC Navy uniform. We should talk to her to learn how she got here.
===========ID 0x0002D431: With the power to Sarah's old shuttle partially restored, Sarah and I were able to locate the telemetry data and pinpoint her former crew's crash site. We should return to our ship and proceed there to continue the investigation.
===========ID 0x0002D432: The telemetry data for Sarah's crew's crash site is within her former shuttle's wreckage. I'll need to find an Emergency Power Cell to bring her old computer back online.
===========ID 0x0002D433: Sarah and I have landed on Cassiopeia I, near the campsite where her own shuttle crashed years ago. I should speak to her to begin investigating how to track down the second crash site, the location of her crew.
===========ID 0x0002D434: After confronting Admiral Logan, Sarah and I have discovered that her crew was lost at a specific site on Cassiopeia I. We should proceed there to begin our investigation into the fate of her crew.
===========ID 0x0002D435: I've been asked by Sarah Morgan to help discover the fate of the crew of the UC Dauntless, a ship she commanded and was lost during the Colony War. To begin, we should speak to Admiral Logan in New Atlantis, who might have the information we need.
===========ID 0x0002D456: We survived the Starborn attack, but not everyone made it.
===========ID 0x0002D457: I found a new home for the Artifacts. I should head back to the Lodge.
===========ID 0x0002D458: The Artifacts aren't safe at the Lodge anymore. I could place the Armillary on my ship. Or I could land on a planet and build a defensible outpost, and place the Armillary there.
===========ID 0x0002D459: The Hunter has found us! I have to get Noel, and the Artifacts, to my ship so we can escape.
===========ID 0x0002D45A: I need to find Noel. She escaped through a secret door in the Lodge's basement.
===========ID 0x0002D45B: I've rescued everyone onboard the Eye. I need to head back to the Lodge. Hopefully I'm not too late to stop the Hunter.
===========ID 0x0002D45C: I've decided to run to the Eye and rescue the people onboard the station. Hopefully the Lodge can hold off the Hunter without me.
===========ID 0x0002D45D: We should return to Noel and regroup.
===========ID 0x0002D45E: We need to get to the Eye. Hopefully we're not too late to save everyone on the station.
===========ID 0x0002D45F: Noel has packed up the Artifacts. We need to get to the ship and grav jump away from the area so the Hunter can't track us.
===========ID 0x0002D460: I stayed to defend the Lodge. The Hunter has arrived. I need to give Noel time to pack up the Artifacts so we can escape.
===========ID 0x0002D461: A Starborn known as the Hunter has attacked the Eye and is coming to the Lodge.
===========ID 0x0002D462: Something has gone wrong onboard The Eye. I need to see if Noel has been in contact with Vladimir.
===========ID 0x0002D468: I successfully uploaded a program onto a CeltCorp computer.
===========ID 0x0002D469: I successfully uploaded the program onto a CeltCorp computer. I need to return to Imogene at Ryujin Tower and let her know it's done.
===========ID 0x0002D46A: I need to get into CeltCorp at Neon's Trade Tower and upload the program on the slate that Imogene gave me. Ideally, I need to do this without getting caught.
===========ID 0x0002D46B: Imogene promoted me on my first day of work. I should talk to her and find out what my new job entails.
===========ID 0x0002D484: To complete this exam, I've got to take down as many enemy ships as I can without my ship being downed. The more I destroy, the better my score.
===========ID 0x0002D49A: Commander Tuala has agreed to let me deliver this sample on behalf of Hadrian. Looks like I'm heading to the Trade Authority on Mars to try and find Percival Walker.
===========ID 0x0002D49B: Hadrian's asked that I get permission from my commander to take this tissue sample to Percival Walker on Mars. I need to return to Commander Tuala in New Atlantis and see what he says.
===========ID 0x0002D49C: Hadrian's finished analyzing the sample, and seems... concerned. I should find out what she uncovered.
===========ID 0x0002D49D: I gave Hadrian the tissue sample. She's asked me to accompany her so we can start getting some answers on this thing.
===========ID 0x0002D49E: I collected the tissue sample for Hadrian. Now I just need to return it to her back at the main building.
===========ID 0x0002D49F: I killed the Terrormorph! I should collect that sample Hadrian was asking for.
===========ID 0x0002D4A0: All the turrets are back online, which should make killing the Terrormorph that much easier... I hope.
===========ID 0x0002D4A3: I met Hadrian, a former UC researcher brought here by the rumor of an anomalous Terrormorph. She asked me to head to the nearby security outpost and reset her connection to it so she can try and get the facility's defenses back online.
===========ID 0x0002D4A4: Someone in one of the factory buildings just contacted me on my radio. They told me to meet them in the building with the large "Tau" sign on it.
===========ID 0x0002D4A5: There's someone alive in one of the factory buildings! She says I should meet her on the second floor of the main building.
===========ID 0x0002D4A6: I just heard a very inhuman scream from the factory nearby. I should see what happened.
===========ID 0x0002D4A7: I've spoken to Crew Chief Herath and have acquired Tau Ceti II's repair materials. I should head there to drop them off as soon as possible.
===========ID 0x0002D4A8: Commander Tuala directed me to speak to Crew Chief Herath at the New Atlantis spaceport in order to collect the materials I'll be delivering to Tau Ceti II.
===========ID 0x0002D4AE: I've dealt with one of GalBank's deadbeats and got rewarded for my efforts. But there are always more fish in this particular sea.
===========ID 0x0002D4AF: GalBank's debt has been collected. Now I just need to return to Landry Hollifeld in New Atlantis to get paid.
===========ID 0x0002D4B0: I've been given a job from GalBank to collect some delinquent debt. Landry Hollifeld would prefer I handle it non-violently, if possible.
===========ID 0x0002D4BC: I did my best to sway Zola Adisa and Arthur Cruz away from the deal with Infinity LTD, and I swapped out Nina Hart's presentation. I need to return to Imogene at Ryujin Tower and let her know it's done. 
===========ID 0x0002D4BD: I did my best to influence Zola Adisa and Arthur Cruz against the deal with Infinity LTD. All I have left to do is swap out Nina Hart's presentation with the fabricated one that Imogene gave me.
===========ID 0x0002D4BE: My latest assignment is to sabotage a deal between Quantum Synergies and Infinity LTD. First, I need to sway the Quantum reps, Zola Adisa and Arthur Cruz against the deal. I should reference the dossiers Imogene gave me for talking points.
===========ID 0x0002D4BF: I need to speak to Imogene about my next assignment.
===========ID 0x0002D4C8: I successfully planted an ARC device for Ryujin Industries at <Alias=ChosenLocation>.
===========ID 0x0002D4C9: I successfully planted the ARC device. I need to return to Imogene at Ryujin Tower to let her know.
===========ID 0x0002D4CA: I need to plant the ARC device I was given in <Alias=ChosenLocation>. I should be careful and not get caught.
===========ID 0x0002D4CB: I need to travel to <Alias=ChosenLocation> on <Alias=ChosenPlanetLocation> in the <Alias=ChosenSystemLocation> system to plant an ARC device.
===========ID 0x0002D4CC: I should talk to Imogene to find out what my next assignment is.
===========ID 0x0002D4D1: I delivered Mr. Sood's package to Tom Starrett. I have no idea what it was about, but the pay was right.
===========ID 0x0002D4D2: I have been asked by a mysterious Mr. Sood to smuggle a package into Akila City and deliver it to Tom Starrett.
===========ID 0x0002D4DD: I obtained a prototype schematic from <Alias=ChosenLocation> in order for Ryujin to stay ahead of the competition.
===========ID 0x0002D4DE: I obtained the prototype schematic at <Alias=ChosenLocation>. I need to return to Masako at her office in Ryujin Tower to hand it over.
===========ID 0x0002D4DF: I obtained the prototype schematic at <Alias=ChosenLocation>. I need to return to Imogene at her office in Ryujin Tower to hand it over.
===========ID 0x0002D4E0: I've been tasked with obtaining a prototype schematic at <Alias=ChosenLocation>. Ideally, I need to find a way to get it without getting caught.
===========ID 0x0002D4E1: I need to travel to <Alias=ChosenLocation> on <Alias=ChosenLocation_Planet> in the <Alias=ChosenLocation_System> System in order to obtain the prototype schematic.
===========ID 0x0002D4E2: I was told Masako wants to see me. I need to go to the Executive Offices floor of Ryujin Tower and find out what she wants.
===========ID 0x0002D4E3: I need to talk to Imogene at her office in Ryujin Tower to see what's next on her list of things to do.
===========ID 0x0002D4EC: Adella Faheem's Tracker problem is dealt with for now.
===========ID 0x0002D4ED: Adella was right. A Tracker was after after her - named Ernesto. I convinced him to let her go. I should report back to Adella.
===========ID 0x0002D4EE: Adella Faheem eludes her tracker in HopeTown. It's anyone's guess if she'll stay safe next time.
===========ID 0x0002D4EF: Adella was right. A Tracker was after her - named Ernesto. He's dead, and I should report back.
===========ID 0x0002D4F0: Adella Faheem has a Tracker that's been sent after her in the Pit Stop. I've volunteered to pose as her and deal with him. He's wearing a cowboy hat.
===========ID 0x0002D4FC: I did my final interview with SSNN and Nadia Muffaz. Nadia gave me a nice bonus for all my help.
===========ID 0x0002D4FD: SSNN is the main news outlet in the Settled Systems. Their lead researcher, Nada Muffaz, is willing to pay me good money for stories I may encounter in my journeys.
===========ID 0x0002D4FE: Nadia Muffaz is a researcher for SSNN. She's looking for information on the attack on Vectera and is willing to pay for it.
===========ID 0x0002D4FF: A stranger wants to talk to me. I should see what he has to say.
===========ID 0x0002D514: Both Ularu and Masako are concerned over the Project Dominion leak. I need to talk to Masako about the situation.
===========ID 0x0002D515: Ularu was shocked to learn that Infinity LTD has information on Project Dominion. I need to follow her to Masako's office where she'll deliver the information.
===========ID 0x0002D516: I've obtained the data on Project Dominion. I need to return to Ularu Chen at Ryujin Tower in Neon to give her the information.
===========ID 0x0002D517: I need to get my hands on Project Dominion. I have to find a way to access Stanley McMillan's computer in the Deimos Staryards Corporate office and download the files to the untraceable storage slate.
===========ID 0x0002D518: Simon gave me information on a man named Stanley McMillan. I need to examine the slates to see what I can learn in order to get my hands on Project Dominion.
===========ID 0x0002D519: I killed Simon before he could hand over whatever information he had. I should search his body for anything that seems useful.
===========ID 0x0002D51A: Now that I have Malai Liskova's gun, Ember, I can give it to Simon in Cydonia in exchange for the information he has on Project Dominion.
===========ID 0x0002D51B: I need to retrieve Malai's gun and bring it back to Simon in Cydonia in exchange for the information he has on Project Dominion.
===========ID 0x0002D51D: Malai agreed to hand over her gun, Ember. I need to board her ship, the Datura, in order to get it.
===========ID 0x0002D51E: I've accepted Malai's hail. Perhaps she will hand over the gun and I won't have to kill her.
===========ID 0x0002D51F: I need to destroy the Datura to kill Malai Liskova and bring her gun back to Simon as proof of death.
===========ID 0x0002D520: Simon offered a side job in exchange for the information he has: to kill a woman named Malai Liskova and bring her gun back as proof. Her ship, the Datura, is in orbit around Saturn.
===========ID 0x0002D521: I need to find one of Ularu's contacts, Simon Ryczek, in Cydonia and negotiate a deal for the information he has. 
===========ID 0x0002D522: I need to travel to Cydonia on Mars in the Sol system. From there, I need to find one of Ularu's contacts, Simon Ryczek, and negotiate a deal for the information he has. 
===========ID 0x0002D523: Ularu Chen is wrapping up a meeting. I should wait until she's finished before approaching her.
===========ID 0x0002D524: On my way to Ularu Chen's office, a woman asked if she can help me. I should talk to her and let her know I'm here to see Ularu.
===========ID 0x0002D525: Imogene said her boss, Ularu Chen, would like to see me about my next assignment. I need to report to her office on the Executive Floor of Ryujin Tower and find out the details.
===========ID 0x0002D53D: I helped the Stroud-Eklund R&D team get their project back on track and we managed to finish the design for their new ship.
===========ID 0x0002D53E: Production on Stroud-Eklund's latest ship is back on track. I should report to Walter and let him know.
===========ID 0x0002D53F: The team seems more willing to work with one another now, so all that's left is talking to Jules about the final ship design.
===========ID 0x0002D540: I've collected the market research data. Now, I need to speak with Jules about the issues preventing her team from working well with one another.
===========ID 0x0002D541: Jules asked me to fly missions from the mission board. The data I collect will be used to make design decisions. Collecting more data will allow them to build a ship to handle a variety of situations.
===========ID 0x0002D542: Now that we've solved the budget issues for this project, Jules would like me to help gather some market research data. I should speak with her to find out what that entails.
===========ID 0x0002D543: Jules has asked me to meet the rest of the team and give them feedback on their ship design proposals.
===========ID 0x0002D544: Jules will only agree to go with the highest budget proposal for this ship if I contribute a large amount of money out of my own pocket.
===========ID 0x0002D545: I think I may be able to get into the Stroud-Eklund corporate systems and approve a higher budget. That way, we can build whatever we want without worrying about the cost.
===========ID 0x0002D546: I need to speak with the project lead, Jules and find out what I can do to help get this project back on track.
===========ID 0x0002D547: Walter Stroud wants me to help his R&D team with their next shipbuilding project. Development has stalled, and he believes I can get it back on track.
===========ID 0x0002D564: I helped Louisa Reyez as she investigated a power drain in the Well in New Atlantis. By deactivating a series of junction boxes, she was able to trace the source of the drain to the Trade Authority.
===========ID 0x0002D565: I've finished powering down the junction boxes, and need to return to Louisa Reyez to find out what she's learned.
===========ID 0x0002D566: I've agreed to help Louisa Reyez track a power drain in the Well in New Atlantis. I need to locate a series of power junction boxes and turn them off.
===========ID 0x0002D567: Louisa Reyez is investigating a power drain in the Well, and may need some help. I should speak to her if I want to assist.
===========ID 0x0002D571: I was able to get the data from Emilio for Kelton. He's going to look over it and see what he can find out about the tree.
===========ID 0x0002D572: I've acquired the data that Kelton Frush needs, and should deliver it to him.
===========ID 0x0002D573: Emilio Hadek insists that before he'll hand over the data I need, I must delete his personnel file from the MAST network. I need to access the terminal in the Chief Engineer's apartment in New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D574: I've agreed to help Kelton Frush by talking to his co-worker, Emilio, about getting some additional data on trees in New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D575: I've once again met Kelton Frush, the botanist from MAST. He's struggling to gather more data on the phenomenon with the tree in New Atlantis, and has asked for my help.
===========ID 0x0002D57F: I found Nyssa's missing friend and helped resolve a dispute over a location for her ever-expanding business enterprise.
===========ID 0x0002D580: I reported my success in Sub 12 to Sasha, and now just need to give the good news to Nyssa.
===========ID 0x0002D581: I've resolved the situation in Sub 12, and can let both Sasha and Nyssa know that it's safe for them to use.
===========ID 0x0002D582: I've found Sub 12 in the Well. Now I just need to handle the squatters who put Sasha in MedBay.
===========ID 0x0002D583: Sasha Alessio landed in MedBay after tangling with some thugs in a section of the Well that might be useful for Nyssa Marcano's business. She's asked that I try and deal with them instead.
===========ID 0x0002D584: I'm looking for Nyssa Marcano's friend Sasha, who might be found in MedBay in the Well.
===========ID 0x0002D585: Nyssa Marcano is looking for her friend Sasha, who was supposed to be scouting business locations in the Well. She suggested I start by asking for Sasha in Kay's Place.
===========ID 0x0002D586: Nyssa has asked me for help locating a friend. I should talk to her when I'm able to assist.
===========ID 0x0002D591: Funding for Nyssa's operation has been secured. Now I just need to give her time and see what she does with it.
===========ID 0x0002D592: I need to let Nyssa Marcano know I've secured a second investor for her business.
===========ID 0x0002D593: I've agreed to invest some of my own credits into Nyssa's business venture.
===========ID 0x0002D594: I've found an investor for Nyssa Marcano's business, but she is adamant that she wants one other party involved. I should use connections I've made during my travels, or offer to get involved myself.
===========ID 0x0002D595: I need to inform Nyssa Marcano that Walter Stroud will be investing in her business.
===========ID 0x0002D596: Walter Stroud has agreed to help fund Nyssa Marcano's business, but has first asked that I speak with his wife Issa.
===========ID 0x0002D597: Nyssa Marcano has asked me to talk to Walter Stroud about investing in her business expansion.
===========ID 0x0002D598: Nyssa Marcano has asked me for more help expanding her business. I should talk to her when I'm able to help.
===========ID 0x0002D5A8: The audio broadcast helped to calm the tree down, and it looks like a potential disaster has been avoided. Kelton can finally rest easy.
===========ID 0x0002D5A9: That... seems to have worked? I should check in with Kelton and see what he thinks.
===========ID 0x0002D5AA: The broadcast is all set to run. I should return to the tree.
===========ID 0x0002D5AB: I was able to get Nadia Muffaz to handle the broadcast for me.
===========ID 0x0002D5AC: I have to run a diagnostic to make sure the upload is working.
===========ID 0x0002D5AD: I need to get into an SSNN terminal and upload the audio that Kelton synthesized. 
===========ID 0x0002D5AE: Kelton has completed his analysis. I should check in with him.
===========ID 0x0002D5AF: I need to wait for Kelton to complete his analysis.
===========ID 0x0002D5B0: I have the branch. I should get back to Kelton as soon as I can.
===========ID 0x0002D5B1: I need to buy the branch from Earl when I have enough credits.
===========ID 0x0002D5B2: Leah told me that Earl might have a branch for me. I should check in with him.
===========ID 0x0002D5B3: I was able to convince Leah to hand over the branch.
===========ID 0x0002D5B4: I need to get the tree branch from Leah somehow. I could try to convince her to give it to me, or I could try to steal it...
===========ID 0x0002D5B5: I need to go get the tree branch from Leah Casler.
===========ID 0x0002D5B6: Kelton told me that getting a tree branch from Akila City will help calm the tree down. I should speak to him when I'm ready.
===========ID 0x0002D5C9: I traced a power drain to an apartment in New Atlantis, where it seems someone was running some kind of hacking operation into GalBank's system. I've handed over the data in the hopes that the culprit can be found.
===========ID 0x0002D5CA: I've found proof that someone is drawing huge amounts of power to hack into GalBank's system in New Atlantis. I need to decide who should get the data: either Louisa Reyez of MAST or Zoe Kaminski of the Trade Authority.
===========ID 0x0002D5CB: I've traced the source of the power drain in the Well to the Athena Tower building in New Atlantis. I need to investigate further.
===========ID 0x0002D5CC: Louisa Reyez is now working with Zoe Kaminski of the Trade Authority in New Atlantis to track down the origins of a power drain. I need to help them by shutting down certain power junction boxes.
===========ID 0x0002D5CD: I've agreed to help Louisa Reyez confront the Trade Authority in the Well in New Atlantis. I need to make sure she stays safe.
===========ID 0x0002D5E9: As agreed, I supplied <Global=OE_KMK_Supply01Amount> <Alias=PrimaryRef> to <Alias=OE_Location> on <Alias=TargetPlanetLocation>.
===========ID 0x0002D5EA: I'll need to set up a cargo link from one of my outposts to supply this facility with <Global=OE_KMK_Supply01Amount> <Alias=PrimaryRef>.
===========ID 0x0002D5FA: There are two ships at Oborum, the Scorpius and the Helix. They're hailing me.
===========ID 0x0002D5FB: It is time to meet with the Hunter and the Emissary. I know the way.
===========ID 0x0002D5FC: The "scorpion" of Hyla is actually a statue of the Scorpius constellation. A light is shining through the point representing the star of Oborum.
===========ID 0x0002D5FD: "On Hyla II, the island hides the scorpion, and the scorpion's sting hides the truth."
===========ID 0x0002D5FE: I think I've found the resting place of the Pilgrim that Keeper Aquilus spoke about. I should look around and see if he's left anything that tells me about Unity.
===========ID 0x0002D5FF: I think I know the Unity Pilgrim's final resting place. It's on the second planet of the Indum system.
===========ID 0x0002D600: I think I know the Unity Pilgrim's final resting place. It's on the second planet of the Indum system.
===========ID 0x0002D601: I now have three clues to the Pilgrim's final resting place. "Infinitum addendum," "Second," and "Four and One-Hundred Twenty."
===========ID 0x0002D602: Keeper Aquilus believes there was a Pilgrim who kept the truth about "Unity" in a location hidden in stories told to the Sanctum Universum, the House of Enlightenment, and House Va'ruun.
===========ID 0x0002D603: Matteo believes the word "Unity" may have hidden meanings to the Sanctum Universum. We should talk to Keeper Aquilus at the Sanctum.
===========ID 0x0002D615: I found the First's base of operations at the abandoned mech factory on Arcturus II. I confronted Major Paxton Hull, who revealed that the First were hired by HopeTech president Ron Hope. Now it's time to confront Hope and find out why he used mercenaries to take land from farmers.
===========ID 0x0002D616: I've found the First's base of operations at the abandoned mech factory on Arcturus II. I've fought my way through mercenary soldiers and now I've come face to face with Major Paxton Hull, leader of the First. It's time to find out why the First are seizing land from farmers, and who they're working for.
===========ID 0x0002D617: Upon landing at the abandoned mech factory on Arcturus II, I was challenged by Major Paxton Hull, disgraced former war hero and leader of the First mercenary company, to come and get him. It won't be an easy fight, but there's no other choice if I'm going to learn the First's plans.
===========ID 0x0002D618: My investigation of the First continues. When I arrived at Arcturus II to check out an abandoned mech factory, I was attacked by mercenary patrol ships. This would seem to confirm Marshal Blake's guess that the factory is indeed the First's base of operations. I'll need to investigate the facility to be certain.
===========ID 0x0002D619: My investigation of the First mercenaries continues. Ranger Alex Shadid decrypted the slates I brought him and learned that the First have a base called the Factory. Marshal Blake thinks it might be the abandoned mech factory on Arcturus II. 
===========ID 0x0002D61A: I'm investigating a mercenary group called the First that's seizing land from farmers. I've acquired encrypted slates from key members of the outfit and given them to Ranger Alex Shadid for decryption. I should check in with Marshal Blake.
===========ID 0x0002D621: A tourist named Miguel Rivas has undergone a facial transformation, much to the dismay of his fiance. Miguel asked me to talk to her on his behalf, and I convinced her to give him a second chance.
===========ID 0x0002D622: A tourist named Miguel Rivas has undergone a facial transformation, much to the dismay of his fiance. Miguel asked me to talk to her on his behalf, but I recommended she break up with him instead. I delivered the news to Miguel, who was devastated by the news.
===========ID 0x0002D623: A tourist named Miguel Rivas has undergone a facial transformation, much to the dismay of his fiance. Miguel asked me to talk to her on his behalf, but I recommended she break up with him instead.
===========ID 0x0002D624: A tourist named Miguel Rivas has undergone a facial transformation, much to the dismay of his fiance. Miguel has asked me to talk to her on his behalf.
===========ID 0x0002D633: I decided to leave the Unity and return to my universe. If I change my mind, I can return to the Unity by powering up my Grav Drive while the Armillary is in my ship.
===========ID 0x0002D634: If I continue through the path in the Unity, then I'll leave my universe behind forever, and become a Starborn in the multiverse. But I can also leave, and return to my life in this universe.
===========ID 0x0002D635: I'm here, in the Unity. There's someone in the distance.
===========ID 0x0002D636: Now that the completed Armillary is on my ship, I just need to power up the Grav Drive to go to the Unity. I should remove the Armillary from my ship if I want to grav jump anywhere else.
===========ID 0x0002D637: I have all the Artifacts. I need to assemble them into the Armillary onboard my ship.
===========ID 0x0002D63E: Due to staffing issues, Sergeant Yumi has asked me to work as a part-time Security Officer. I was directed to Agent Plato at MAST, who asked me to pick up a package near the transit station. I located the package and delivered it to Sergeant Yumi.
===========ID 0x0002D63F: Due to staffing issues, Sergeant Yumi has asked me to work as a part-time Security Officer. I was directed to Agent Plato at MAST, who asked me to pick up a package near the transit station. I located the package and can now deliver it to Sergeant Yumi.
===========ID 0x0002D640: Due to staffing issues, Sergeant Yumi has asked me to work as a part-time Security Officer. I was directed to Agent Plato at MAST, who asked me to pick up a package near the transit station.
===========ID 0x0002D641: Due to staffing issues, Sergeant Yumi has asked me to work as a part-time Security Officer. I declined the offer and was told to leave.
===========ID 0x0002D642: Due to staffing issues, Sergeant Yumi has asked me to work as a part-time Security Officer. For my first job, I need to talk to Agent Plato over at MAST.
===========ID 0x0002D659: Vae Victis is going to arrange to have the research team arrive at the Red Devils HQ. All but one - Kaiser - who I'll need to recover from Niira. Vae Victis suggested I check in with Hadrian first, as she'll likely have more information about this missing teammate.
===========ID 0x0002D65A: I've handed over the ID. Time to get the location of Hadrian and Percival's research team.
===========ID 0x0002D65B: Vae Victis has asked me to hand over the evidence I collected that Orlase is dead. I should approach the transfer system.
===========ID 0x0002D65C: I found Orlase's old United Colonies ID. This should be sufficient evidence to prove to Vae Victis the job is done.
===========ID 0x0002D65D: I destroyed the Warlock - and its pilot with it. I need to search the wreckage, find evidence this was Orlase.
===========ID 0x0002D65E: Orlase killed himself rather than be captured. I guess I should check him for evidence I could show to Vae Victis.
===========ID 0x0002D660: I've found the Warlock. And whoever's piloting it doesn't sound pleased I'm here. Time to either disable his engines to capture him (using an EM Weapon or the Targeting Control Systems skill)... or shoot him out of the sky. 
===========ID 0x0002D661: Captain Marquez has given me the coordinates I need to find "The Warlock," a ship that may be home to Orlase. But she warned me to be careful - a number of ships have been lost in the debris fields where the Warlock's been seen. 
===========ID 0x0002D662: I just spoke to Vae Victis, a former UC admiral and a man who's supposed to be dead. He asked me to track down - and "deal with" - a rogue weapons scientist named Reginald Orlase. He believes Orlase is hiding near the planet of Etherea in the Wolf system, and that I should speak to the local head of the Vanguard - Captain Marquez - to get specifics.
===========ID 0x0002D663: There's someone living down here... and he's asked to speak to me. 
===========ID 0x0002D664: Someone's requested to speak with me, but Deputy MacIntyre won't tell me who. She said I can find them down in Subsection Seven.
===========ID 0x0002D66D: I went to go get a first edition copy of a Dragonstar Force book for Mitch Benjamin, which he paid me for.
===========ID 0x0002D66E: I managed to find the Dragonstar Force book for Mitch. He said he'll pay me when I bring it back to him.
===========ID 0x0002D66F: Mitch Benjamin has asked me to go get a first edition copy of a book in the Dragonstar Force series from an off-world vendor.
===========ID 0x0002D681: After getting the runaround from both Peter Brennan and Governor Hurst, I was able to approve Trevor's request for new mining equipment.
===========ID 0x0002D682: I've got access to Mr. Brennan's computer. I need to approve Trevor's request for mining tools.
===========ID 0x0002D683: I have Mr. Brennan's shipment. I need to return to him. Then, he'll allow me to access his computer.
===========ID 0x0002D684: I've finished with Hurst's ship. Now I need to tell him the job's done, so he'll release Mr. Brennan's shipment and I can finally move on with my task to help the miners.
===========ID 0x0002D685: I'm going to search for clues aboard Hurst's ship. There must be some reason he wanted it destroyed.
===========ID 0x0002D686: I boarded Governor Hurst's ship. Things escalated with the pirates. Now I need to deal with them, one way or another.
===========ID 0x0002D687: I decided to destroy Hurst's ship like he asked. He should be pleased with the results once I finish here and return to him.
===========ID 0x0002D688: I found Hurst's ship. I could try to hail it and try to convince them to allow me on board so I can get to the bottom of this, or I can just destroy it and return to him.
===========ID 0x0002D689: Governor Hurst will release Mr. Brennan's shipment if I do him a favor first. He wouldn't tell me exactly why, but I am to find and destroy Hurst's stolen spaceship.
===========ID 0x0002D68A: Mr. Brennan is expecting a personal shipment. He expects me to find it before he'll let me access his computer. He suggested checking with Governor Hurst, as his previous assistants did.
===========ID 0x0002D68B: I'm now Peter Brennan's executive assistant. I should go report to him at the Deimos Staryards Corporate Office on the main floor of Cydonia.
===========ID 0x0002D694: I agreed to help Trevor Petyarre get his request for new mining equipment approved by Peter Brennan, a Deimos executive. After proving I'm serious about helping, I then had to apply for a job as Peter's assistant, which we made sure I got.
===========ID 0x0002D695: I've deleted all the other applications so that only mine remains in the system. I need to return to Trevor to let him know I've accomplished this.
===========ID 0x0002D696: Trevor wants me to delete all the other applications for the job on the HR computer upstairs in the corporate office. I'll need to wait until the evening for the HR staff to leave the office, then sneak in.
===========ID 0x0002D697: I've applied to the executive assistant job. Now I need to speak with Trevor so he can tell me how to ensure I'm picked for the job.
===========ID 0x0002D698: Trevor needs me to help him get a request for new equipment approved by the Deimos mining executive. I'm supposed to apply to be the executive's assistant through the company's application system up at Deimos Staryards.
===========ID 0x0002D699: After delivering the ore, I need to speak with Trevor so he can tell me about my next task.
===========ID 0x0002D69A: I've acquired enough ore for Trevor. I need to deposit it in the bin so it can be processed.
===========ID 0x0002D69B: I offered to do some work for Trevor Petyarre, but before he gives me my task, he needs to know he can trust me. I've agreed to help him by mining some additional ore to add to his team's quota.
===========ID 0x0002D6A8: I managed to deal with Hank and get the stolen equipment back for the Cydonia miners. Now they'll be able to do their jobs more easily thanks to my efforts.
===========ID 0x0002D6A9: I need to return to Trevor and let him know what happened with Hank and the equipment.
===========ID 0x0002D6AA: Hank has agreed to turn himself in. I'll escort him to Security to make sure he follows through.
===========ID 0x0002D6AB: There's no reasoning with Hank. I have to kill him.
===========ID 0x0002D6AC: Hank turned on me. I need to deal with him and get the equipment back.
===========ID 0x0002D6AD: Hank admitted to stealing the new equipment because he wanted to sabotage the entire mining operation. But, it sounds like he's going to give it up willingly. I should follow him to where he's stashed it.
===========ID 0x0002D6AE: Hank is at the Broken Spear. I need to interrogate him about his shady behavior.
===========ID 0x0002D6AF: Hank has not returned, and now Trevor seems suspicious of what Hank could be up to. He wants me to investigate, and suggested that I start by seeing if Hank is at the Broken Spear.
===========ID 0x0002D6B0: Ship services mentioned that they saw Hank return to Mars, but he didn't land at the port. This is unusual, so I should check with Trevor to see what I should do next.
===========ID 0x0002D6B1: Trevor is worried that Hank hasn't returned with the equipment yet, so he wants me to check with ship services to see if they noticed anything unusual.
===========ID 0x0002D6B2: I've approved Trevor's request for new mining equipment. I should go speak with him about it and let him know.
===========ID 0x0002D6BB: Another package delivered and Yannick's Blend will continue to flow.
===========ID 0x0002D6BC: Yannick wasn't pleased about the loss of the package. But we're still in business.
===========ID 0x0002D6BD: I have Yannick's package of Aurora. I should deliver it to him.
===========ID 0x0002D6BE: A beggar found the package of Aurora. My choice was to either kill for it, or let it go. I'm now about to murder someone for Yannick's Blend. Now I just need to tell Yannick that.
===========ID 0x0002D6BF: Robie gave me the location where she stored the Aurora package for Yannick.
===========ID 0x0002D6C0: I've finished my manufacturing shift. I should now talk with Robie to find where to pick up Aurora for Yannick.
===========ID 0x0002D6C1: It's time to smuggle some more Aurora, but first I have to do a shift for Xenofresh.
===========ID 0x0002D6C2: After a tense meeting with Benjamin Bayu, Yannick and I were spared - but Yannick's Aurora smuggling operation is under Bayu's control now. I should see how Yannick is doing.
===========ID 0x0002D6CD: I helped a local Cydonia UC Exchange manager with his missing ship. After finding the ship overrun with heat leeches, I eliminated them and checked the integrity of the cargo, then returned to Denis.
===========ID 0x0002D6CE: I eliminated the heat leeches and checked the cargo aboard Denis' ship. I should return to him to let him know what I found.
===========ID 0x0002D6CF: I found Denis' ship, but it appears the crew is dead and the ship is overrun with heat leeches. I should eliminate them and check all the cargo before returning to him.
===========ID 0x0002D6D0: The manager of the Cydonia UC Exchange, Denis Averin, is missing a shipment. The ship itself did not land where it was supposed to. I volunteered to help investigate. 
===========ID 0x0002D6D9: Briggs was excited to have a solid lead on how the Disciples have such hi-tech weapons. I passed my audition and I'm officially a member of the Ebbside Strikers. 
===========ID 0x0002D6DA: I found a slate which shows that the Disciples have some Kore Kinetics military hardware which has made them substantially more dangerous. The Ebbside Striker leader, Briggs, should be informed.
===========ID 0x0002D6DB: According to Briggs, if I want to join the Ebbside Strikers, I need to find out where the Disciples got their serious military hardware, which has changed the balance between the gangs.
===========ID 0x0002D6DC: The Ebbside Strikers are a local gang that are holed up at Madam Sauvage's Place. Apparently they've been taking a beating from the Disciples, a rival gang. Maybe the Strikers could use some help against them?
===========ID 0x0002D6EE: I helped Gilly Seong, the Deimos Staryards psychologist, collect evaluations on some of the current employees.
===========ID 0x0002D6EF: All of the Deimos employees have filled out their psychological evaluations. Time to return to Gilly.
===========ID 0x0002D6F0: Gilly has asked me to deliver psychological evaluation questionnaires to some of the Deimos Staryards employees here on Cydonia, and return them to her once they are all completed.
===========ID 0x0002D6FB: After a lot of credits changing hands, I put down the Strikers for the Disciples. Ebbside's not going to get any better (probably worse) - but I got paid a mint.
===========ID 0x0002D6FC: The Strikers are no more. Owen Dexler offered them a job working for Neon Security with the mandate to keep the Disciples in check. It's as happy an ending as you see on Neon.
===========ID 0x0002D6FD: Neon Security has offered to hire the Strikers to continue to keep the Disciples in check - except officially. Owen Dexler has asked me to make sure Briggs makes the right decision.
===========ID 0x0002D6FE: After defeating the Disciples, I heard a commotion downstairs. I should investigate.
===========ID 0x0002D6FF: It's show time. Time to hit the Disciples back where it hurts.
===========ID 0x0002D700: I dealt with all the Disciple hangouts. Now I need to regroup with the Strikers for the final assault on one of the Disciples bases.
===========ID 0x0002D701: I made a deal with the Disciples to betray the Strikers. They've offered me a lot more credits than the Strikers will pay. All I have to do is take out the Strikers and they'll wire payment. It's not too late for me to help the Strikers.
===========ID 0x0002D702: The Ebbside Strikers are finally going to hit the Disciples back. I need to clear out three hangouts of the Disciples to buy time for Vogal to secure a weapons cache. Briggs also asked me to buy some armor from Newill - he claims he'll pay me back.
===========ID 0x0002D703: The Ebbside Strikers are finally going to hit the Disciples back. To learn the details, I should speak to Vogal.
===========ID 0x0002D712: I helped Jane solve the mystery of her missing ship and returned Erick safely.
===========ID 0x0002D713: I've dealt with the situation as best I could. Now it's time to return to Jane and inform her about what happened.
===========ID 0x0002D714: I've dealt with the Ecliptic mercenaries. Now to free Erick.
===========ID 0x0002D715: Erick appears to be held captive. I should negotiate with Gustavo for his release and control of the ship.
===========ID 0x0002D716: I have permission from the Ecliptic Mercenary captain, Gustavo Valencia to dock with the Berry Mule and board.
===========ID 0x0002D717: I've found the Berry Mule. I should try hailing it to see if I get a response.
===========ID 0x0002D718: Jane's ship, the Berry Mule, and its pilot, Erick have gone missing. She has asked me to search their last known location, around Triton.
===========ID 0x0002D73F: I helped clear ice from New Homestead's power equipment, which restored full power. But, it's only a matter of time before they freeze over again and the brownouts come back.
===========ID 0x0002D740: I cleared away the ice from the power equipment. I should let Joyce know I've finished.
===========ID 0x0002D741: Joyce Osaka, New Homestead's energy technician, asked me to help clear ice away from some of the power equipment out in the field and stop the brownouts. I should use a cutter to clear away the ice.
===========ID 0x0002D743: Cora warns of the Syndicates waiting behind shipping containers.
===========ID 0x0002D744: Cora warns the player about the heavy gunner by the shooting range.
===========ID 0x0002D745: Cora lets the player know an enemy ship is incoming.
===========ID 0x0002D746: Cora points out sniper towers.
===========ID 0x0002D75C: I took a tour of New Homestead with Bill Starsap, where he taught me about the colony's history.
===========ID 0x0002D75D: I decided to take a tour of New Homestead with Bill Starsap, so I can learn more about its history.
===========ID 0x0002D760: I asked a Trade Authority representative about jobs, and was pointed to the local Mission Board, where I was able to find cargo hauling work.
===========ID 0x0002D761: The Trade Authority representative directed me to find cargo hauling jobs at the nearest Mission Board.
===========ID 0x0002D765: I asked a Trackers Alliance Agent about taking on a bounty hunting job, and was pointed to the local Mission Board, where I was able to find such work.
===========ID 0x0002D766: The Trackers Alliance Agent directed me to find bounty hunting jobs at the nearest Mission Board.
===========ID 0x0002D771: Keoni Alpin placed seismic sensors strategically in the city and she has set up a computer to monitor them. In time we may know more about the Ashta.
===========ID 0x0002D772: The guard has been distracted, and Keoni Alpin should have access to her Ashta seismic data now. I should talk with her.
===========ID 0x0002D773: I tried reasoning with the guard to leave the tower, but he didn't budge. I have to create a "ruckus". Maybe if I got arrested for something minor?
===========ID 0x0002D774: In order to process the data about the Ashta, Keoni needs access to a guard tower terminal. There is a guard there, I have to figure a way to get him to leave.
===========ID 0x0002D775: I placed Keoni's sensors. Hopefully that'll give her the data she needs.
===========ID 0x0002D776: Keoni Alpin has seismic sensors she wants placed along Akila City's walls to get data to see if there's a better method to protect against Ashta attacks.
===========ID 0x0002D777: I heard a guard named Davis Wilson arguing with a scientist about trying to develop a way to protect the city better from Ashta. I should find out what's going on.
===========ID 0x0002D796: With Kaiser back, Hadrian's ready to share the plan to stop the Terrormorphs. Sounds like we're heading for Londinion.
===========ID 0x0002D797: We've touched down at the Red Devils base. Kaiser said he'll meet me inside.
===========ID 0x0002D798: Kaiser has agreed to accompany me back to Mars. He says he'll meet me back at my ship.
===========ID 0x0002D799: Kaiser's mission is now complete. I should talk to him about getting off this rock.
===========ID 0x0002D79A: Unit 99 and the Ecliptic forces have been dealt with, but it seems Kaiser still has some business to take care of. I should stay close.
===========ID 0x0002D79B: Kaiser's agreed to help disable Unit 99's control interface, so we don't need to kill the creature. I should cover him as we head back to the outpost.
===========ID 0x0002D79C: I took care of Ecliptic without them releasing Unit 99. I should tell Kaiser so he can disable Unit 99's control interface.
===========ID 0x0002D79D: Ecliptic's taken care of! Now to put down Unit 99!
===========ID 0x0002D79E: Kaiser and I are going to clean out the Ecliptic Outpost and Unit 99 with it. Time to head in and raise hell!
===========ID 0x0002D79F: It seems Unit 99 has been captured by Ecliptic mercenaries. I'm going to head down to the outpost alone and see what's going on.
===========ID 0x0002D7A0: Kaiser's got a bead on Unit 99, but there's a problem. I should speak to him.
===========ID 0x0002D7A1: Kaiser won't leave the planet unless I help him finish his current mission - eliminating the planet's final Xenoweapon, Unit 99 - so that's where we're headed.
===========ID 0x0002D7A2: Kaiser's back at full operational capacity! Time to get him back to Mars!
===========ID 0x0002D7A3: MicroCell acquired. Now I just need to hand it over to Kaiser.
===========ID 0x0002D7A4: I've got the plans to make a MicroCell. So I can either go collect the components from the sites Gel suggested or just buy one from him.
===========ID 0x0002D7A5: It sounds like I can either buy a MicroCell from Gel or manufacture my own. I should read the schematics catalogue Hadrian gave me. Hopefully it's got the plans for a MicroCell.
===========ID 0x0002D7A6: It sounds like I can either buy a MicroCell from Gel or manufacture my own. He gave me a couple sites where I should be able to recover the required components.
===========ID 0x0002D7A7: Gel stated he's got a MicroCell for sale... but also that they have the facilities to make them here. I should ask about that.
===========ID 0x0002D7A8: The Heatleeches have completely drained Kaiser's battery. He'll need a new one. He suggested I ask at the salvage yard if they have one.
===========ID 0x0002D7A9: It looks like Kaiser's been infested with Heatleeches. I'll need to remove them... carefully.
===========ID 0x0002D7AB: I hear the beacon! Kaiser can't be far now!
===========ID 0x0002D7AC: I know how to find Kaiser! Looks like I'm headed towards a nearby crashed spaceship - The Syracuse.
===========ID 0x0002D7AD: Gel's given me two options - wander around Niira's dangerous mech fields in the hopes I stumble upon Kaiser, or pay him for the information.
===========ID 0x0002D7AE: I've now got Kaiser's schematic catalogue and the password for his voice controls: "Nos Belli Machinis." Next stop: 1-Of-A-Kind Salvage on Niira.
===========ID 0x0002D7AF: Hadrian has something she thinks I'll need to recover Kaiser. I should follow her.
===========ID 0x0002D7B0: Vae Victis has given me the location of Kaiser, but expects I'll need some additional information to bring him home. He suggested I check in with Hadrian first.
===========ID 0x0002D7C2: I managed to work out a deal to allow Janet's debt to be forgiven so she can leave Paradiso behind and make a new life for herself.
===========ID 0x0002D7C3: I was able to eliminate Janet's debt so she can leave Paradiso. I should let her know.
===========ID 0x0002D7C4: I need to help pay off Janet's debt it I want her to be free from Paradiso.
===========ID 0x0002D7C5: Janet Yang hates her situation, working off her debt for the Paradiso Group. I'm going to try to help her by negotiating with their CEO, Oliver Campbell, to forgive her debt and let her go.
===========ID 0x0002D7D5: The Alpha Ashta is real, and Keoni is going to work hard to protect Akila City in the future.
===========ID 0x0002D7D6: Davis Wilson was grateful for my help in taking down the Alpha Ashta. I should report back to Keoni Alpin and let her know we're safe.
===========ID 0x0002D7D7: The Ashta killed Davis Wilson. I should report back to Keoni Alpin and let her know what happened.
===========ID 0x0002D7D8: Davis Wilson believes there may be a large Ashta near Akila City. He wants my help in taking it down.
===========ID 0x0002D7D9: I talked with Keoni Alpin, and she's worried that Davis Wilson has been on patrol a great deal recently. She wants me to check up on him.
===========ID 0x0002D7DA: Enough time has passed, Keoni Alpin may have information on the Ashta sensors. I should talk with her.
===========ID 0x0002D7DB: Davis Wilson said that now the seismic sensors can start recording good data. I should come back tomorrow and talk with Keoni Alpin.
===========ID 0x0002D7E0: I managed to work it out with Captain Brackenridge to allow Janet to leave the ECS Constant behind and make a new life for herself.
===========ID 0x0002D7E1: I was able to convince Captain Brackenridge to let Janet leave the ECS Constant. I should let her know.
===========ID 0x0002D7E2: Captain Brackenridge wants me to help supplement the ship's food supply to make up for Janet's absence before she'll let her go.
===========ID 0x0002D7E3: Janet Yang hates her situation, being stuck on board the ECS Constant as it roams the galaxy looking for a new home to settle. I'm going to try to help her by negotiating with Captain Brackenridge to let her go.
===========ID 0x0002D7E8: When I ran into Janet Yang in New Atlantis, she was happy to see me. I delivered a letter to her sister, Julia, who was also very pleased to hear from Janet.
===========ID 0x0002D7E9: Janet asked me to deliver a letter to her sister, Julia. I should bring it to her.
===========ID 0x0002D7EA: I ran into Janet Yang in New Atlantis. She wants to speak with me.
===========ID 0x0002D82C: Together the UC Marines and Freestar Militia managed to make the Altair system safe again, with help from me. Torres and Myeong parted as unlikely friends, hoping they never have to face each other on opposite sides of a battle one day.
===========ID 0x0002D82D: At long last, the Spacer threat in the Altair system has been taken care of. I should talk with Lieutenant Torres.
===========ID 0x0002D82E: The final Spacer assault has begun. We need to clear them out so that the Outpost is finally secure.
===========ID 0x0002D82F: The Spacers no longer have any spaceships in the system. I need to get back to Research Outpost U3-09 and hope I get there before the Spacers attack.
===========ID 0x0002D830: Preparations for the next Spacer attack are under way, but unless we take out their spaceships they will be able to reinforce themselves until we're overwhelmed. There are two Spacer attack groups I need to take out in orbit of Altair I and V.
===========ID 0x0002D831: I've saved the Research Camp. I should report back to Lieutenant Torres and see if he needs more help.
===========ID 0x0002D832: The outpost is secure. The soldiers are going to fortify the outpost for the next Spacer attack. Lieutenant Torres has asked me to rescue some people at a Research Camp elsewhere on Altair II.
===========ID 0x0002D833: Lieutenant Torres wants my help to rescue a United Colonies marine named Captain Myeong. These unlikely allies have been fighting the Spacers together. She's on the second floor guarding the other entrance to the outpost.
===========ID 0x0002D834: The outpost's infirmary is secure. Next up is rescuing the Freestar Militia's commander: Lieutenant Torres. He's on the third floor in Doctor Moussa's office.
===========ID 0x0002D835: I found Private Mahoney, but the whole research outpost has been overrun. Mahoney said I need to make my way to the makeshift infirmary on the first floor and talk to Lezama.
===========ID 0x0002D836: I heard a distress call from Private Mahoney. There is a Freestar Collective research outpost on Altair II that has been overrun with Spacers. They urgently need help.
===========ID 0x0002D837: A merchant told me there is a lot of Spacer activity in the Altair system. He also heard an urgent distress call. I'll have to go to Altair to learn more.
===========ID 0x0002D83A: main objective
===========ID 0x0002D851: Continuing my investigation into the First mercenary company and their effort to seize farmland by force, I tracked Maya Cruz, a high-ranking member of the First, to the Clinic and then to her asteroid hideout. I retrieved an encrypted slate and gave it to Ranger Alex Shadid for decryption.
===========ID 0x0002D852: I obtained an encrypted slate from Maya Cruz, a high-ranking member of the First mercenary company. I need to take it to Alex Shadid at the Rock in Akila City for decryption.
===========ID 0x0002D853: I've tracked down and defeated Maya Cruz, a high-ranking member of the mercenary company called the First. Now it's time to find out what she knows about the First's operations and who hired them to seize land from farmers.
===========ID 0x0002D856: I'm at the Clinic in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. Operations manager Ari Miller gave me another name, Catalina Rivera, a patient staying in the restricted VIP wing. To gain entry, I need to persuade Dr. Titus Cassidy or search his office for a spare key card.
===========ID 0x0002D857: I'm at the Clinic in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. The computer systems are suffering malfunctions, and I used a terminal to trace the disruption to the room of Catalina Rivera, a patient in the restricted VIP wing. To gain entry, I need to persuade Dr. Titus Cassidy or search his office for a spare key card.
===========ID 0x0002D858: I'm at the Clinic in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. In case Maya is using an alias, Ari Miller gave me the names of two female patients who could be her. I spoke to them, but neither fits the profile.
===========ID 0x0002D859: I'm at the Clinic in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. The computer systems are malfunctioning, but operations manager Ari Miller gave me the names of two patients who might be Maya using an alias.
===========ID 0x0002D85A: I'm at the Clinic in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. Operations manager Ari Miller gave me the names of two patients who might be Maya using an alias. He also gave me admin access to a terminal where I can trace an issue disrupting the Clinic's computer systems.
===========ID 0x0002D85B: I'm tracking Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First who recently had emergency surgery. I met Ranger Ben Armistead who introduced me to Ari Miller, the Clinic's operations manager.
===========ID 0x0002D85C: I've arrived at the Clinic in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. I met Ranger Ben Armistead, who's going to introduce me to someone who can help me locate Maya.
===========ID 0x0002D85D: I'm tracking Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First who recently had emergency surgery. Marshal Blake suggested I talk to Ranger Ben Armistead at the Clinic, a sophisticated medical facility.
===========ID 0x0002D879: Kryx's Legacy and the Vigilance are in the hands of the Crimson Fleet, ushering in a new era of piracy that will certainly have a profound effect on the Settled Systems for years to come.
===========ID 0x0002D87A: After resolving everything at the Vigilance, I need to return to the Key and speak to Delgado.
===========ID 0x0002D87B: Commander Ikande is dead and the Vigilance's self-destruct has been disabled.
===========ID 0x0002D87C: Commander Ikande has initiated the Vigilance's self-destruct! If I want to survive, I need to find a way to stop the countdown.
===========ID 0x0002D87D: I'm now face-to-face with Commander Ikande. I should convince him to surrender or kill him if he refuses to comply.
===========ID 0x0002D87E: I am now aboard the Vigilance. I need to fight my way to the Operations Center to gain control of the ship and capture or kill Commander Kibwe Ikande in the process.
===========ID 0x0002D87F: The Defensive Batteries have taken down the Vigilance's advanced shields and it's now vulnerable to attack. I should open fire and disable the ship, so it can be boarded.
===========ID 0x0002D880: UC SysDef's final assault has arrived! I should destroy all of the remaining enemy ships so that the Defensive Batteries can get a clear shot at the Vigilance.
===========ID 0x0002D881: All three Defensive Batteries have been secured and are ready to fire at the Vigilance when it arrives. I should return to the Key and prepare to defend the station itself.
===========ID 0x0002D882: According to Delgado, the Vigilance is on its way to attack. In order to penetrate the ship's advanced shielding, the Key will need to use all three of its remote Defensive Batteries. I need to ensure they remain operational at all costs.
===========ID 0x0002D883: After boarding the Key, Naeva's informed me that UC SysDef has launched a full attack on the Crimson Fleet and Delgado wants to speak to me immediately.
===========ID 0x0002D884: All of the UC SysDef ships attacking the Key have been destroyed. I should now dock with the Key and hand over Kryx's Legacy.
===========ID 0x0002D885: After I secured Kryx's Legacy for the Crimson Fleet, UC SysDef has launched an attack on the Key. Delgado's ordered me to secure the area by destroying the UC ships.
===========ID 0x0002D891: Start enemy wave 3.
===========ID 0x0002D892: Start enemy wave 2.
===========ID 0x0002D893: Start enemy wave 1.
===========ID 0x0002D894: Wait until wave 1 is triggered.
===========ID 0x0002D897: All bogeys down. These UC skies are safe. I should pay Commander Tuala a visit if I'm looking to take down any more.
===========ID 0x0002D898: Commander Tuala's directed me to pay a visit to <Alias=TargetPlanet> and deal with any hostile ships in the area.
===========ID 0x0002D89D: After returning a significant amount of evidence pertaining to the Crimson Fleet, I spoke with Lt. Jillian Toft. Unexpectedly, she's presented me with a gift to thank me for my efforts and bringing criminals to justice.
===========ID 0x0002D89E: After returning a significant amount of evidence pertaining to the Crimson Fleet, I feel I should have a chat with Lt. Jillian Toft.
===========ID 0x0002D89F: I've been tasked by Lt. Jillian Toft on the UC Vigilance to find and bring back any evidence pertaining to Crimson Fleet related illegal activities. Audio logs and text logs would be especially helpful in bringing them to justice.
===========ID 0x0002D8A8: Orval Romack paid me for putting up Vae Victis posters in New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002D8A9: I need to return to the Den and let Orval Romack know I put up the posters as he asked.
===========ID 0x0002D8AA: Orval Romack has offered to pay me if I'll put up some posters of Vae Victis.
===========ID 0x0002D8B0: I've delievered MAST's "commendation" to Bastien Graff at the Den. He seemed grateful for the assistance.
===========ID 0x0002D8B1: I told Bastien Graff that his "commendation" from MAST was nothing more than an attempt to appease him. He's committed to getting what he wants, and thanked me for being honest with him.
===========ID 0x0002D8B2: Bastien Graff at the Den has asked me to follow up with MAST about a promotion he hasn't received. I need to speak with John Tuala.
===========ID 0x0002D8BE: I returned to the Lodge in this universe. Now, the search for the Artifacts continues.
===========ID 0x0002D8BF: I've been reborn in a new universe. I should head back to the Lodge and see if I can pick up the trail of the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002D8CF: I've explored the Lair of the Mantis and found the Mantis's suit and ship. I pressed a button and raised the ship to the surface, so I should go check that out.
===========ID 0x0002D8D0: I arrived at the heart of the Lair of the Mantis. No more traps. This was meant to be for the Mantis's son, Leon. Instead it's all mine.

===========ID 0x0002DA78: I sold the survey data disk to Phil Hill. 
===========ID 0x0002DA79: I have the survey data. I can go back to Phil and sell this.

===========ID 0x0002DA84: I found Reliant Medical's missing courier - dead - but Helena's important package is still at large. We do have a possible suspect, though: Bonifc Maksimov, Reliant Medical's own junior executive, who recently fled the city. Helena's tracked him to the nearby planet Hawley. Looks like that's where I'm headed next.
===========ID 0x0002DA85: Helena's paid me for finding the courier, but is now asking I track down her employee - Bonifac Maksimov - who she suspects might have something to do with the courier's death and the missing package contents.

===========ID 0x0002DABE: I need to run the Overseer program on Lucas and Faye's computers and find the Internal Neuroamp Prototype. I received a maintenance passcode that I can use to sabotage the heating system. This may help clear most of the people out of the building.

===========ID 0x0002DAEA: I've handed out all the recruitment materials, but wasn't able to convince all the local organization heads to put up the posters. I can either speak to Zinaida to wrap things up or try and convince the holdouts.
===========ID 0x0002DAEB: I've handed out all the recruitment materials, and convinced everyone in town to put them up. All that's left now is to speak to Zinaida and collect my reward.
===========ID 0x0002DAEC: Lizzy has both accepted delivery of the recruitment materials and agreed to put them around her bar.
===========ID 0x0002DAED: I've dropped off the recruitment materials with Lizzy, but haven't yet been able to get her to actually put the posters up.

===========ID 0x0002DB27: I've handed over the slate to Sloan. I should listen in to see what they might be able to glean from it.
===========ID 0x0002DB28: I've found an old slate, but it appears to be broken. I should take it back to the Retreat. Maybe they'll be able to make some use out of it.
===========ID 0x0002DB29: I've found what looks to be a set of recently used living quarters. This could be the home to our kidnapper. I should look around for clues.

===========ID 0x0002DB35: The Trackers harassing the Eleos Retreat are dead. I should return to Sloan and let her know.
===========ID 0x0002DB36: The Trackers are here. Time to confront them about the Eleos Retreat.

===========ID 0x0002DB47: I've made it upstairs to where the Retreat's founding donor appears to be hiding. I should check in with her before her muscle gives me any trouble.

===========ID 0x0002E961: Building a power source will supply power to objects like extractors, which require power to function. All powered objects can receive power wirelessly. For example, if you built a water extractor and a wind turbine, you do not have to link the two with a wire in order for the water extractor to receive power.

You can wire a power source to a specific powered object. This can be useful if you don't have enough power sources to wirelessly power every object, or if you'd like to set up powered switches that control things in your outpost. 

To attach a wire from a power source to an object, highlight the power source in "Modify" mode. Press and hold [Confirm] and select "Wire." Highlight an object and press [Confirm]. Now that object will be receiving all of the power source's power output. 
===========ID 0x0002E963: This monument is dedicated to the many intrepid explorers who risked their lives so that humanity could one day find a home among the stars.
===========ID 0x0002E980: It is illegal to smuggle Aurora outside of Neon. Guards will now attempt to arrest you. 
===========ID 0x0002E98E: The ship must be repaired before it can be piloted.
===========ID 0x0002E994: There are many different types of extractors. Most extractors need to be placed on a resource vein. For example, a Benzene extractor must be placed over a Benzene resource vein. Resource veins are highlighted when you are "holding" an extractor in "Build" mode. 

Atmospheric extractors pull resources from the atmosphere and can be placed anywhere. For example, a version of the Helium-3 extractor is atmospheric and does not require a resource vein. Similarly, on planets with water, water extractors can be placed anywhere. 

Extractors have a radius around them where you cannot build an extractor for the same resource. For example, two water extractors cannot be built within each other's radius.
===========ID 0x0002E997: You can store and move resources to containers and builders by using output links. 

To create an output link, enter Modify mode and highlight an extractor, storage container, or builder. Then, press [RTrigger], and select "Output Link." Highlight the storage container or builder you'd like to link to, and press [Confirm]. 

Output links let you automatically "store" and transfer resources to different containers, instead of having to do so manually. You can even link a series of containers to an extractor or builder, and all the produced resources will fill up the containers in sequence, starting with the container "furthest" from the source.

For example, creating an output link from an iron extractor to a Transfer Container will automatically move all the iron produced by the extractor into the container.
===========ID 0x0002E99A: While exploring the Settled Systems, you can survey planets. There are two ways to survey a planet: scanning a planet while in orbit using the galaxy map, and scanning things (such as fauna, flora, resources, and landmarks) on a planet's surface using your handscanner [Monocle]. 

Scanning a planet that has no life or landmarks from orbit can sometimes be enough to fully complete a survey (especially if you have the Scanning skill), but most planets require you to explore them more thoroughly on the ground. 

To fully complete a planet survey, you must scan all of the following: 

- On planets with life, you must scan every species of flora and fauna.

- Every inorganic resource the planet is rich in. 

- Every landmark that reveals a planet's trait.     

Keep in mind that you may need to land in more than one spot on a planet to find everything required for a complete survey.

Some missions require you to find a specific planetary trait. To do this, you must first locate planets within the target system that have traits. If a planet has traits, this is indicated at the top of the planet's info card in the starmap. If a planet has not been surveyed, the traits will show as "Unknown." Once you've found some planets in the system that have traits, your next step is to explore them and find landmarks that reveal the planet's traits. When you're exploring, you can use the handscanner to find points of interest in the distance. When you locate a landmark that is related to the trait you are looking for, scan the unusual features of the landmark to learn more about the trait.

Surveying a planet will increase your total Survey Percentage. When you reach 100% total Survey Percentage, you will be awarded a data slate of survey data that can be sold. Additionally, fully completing a survey will reward you with XP and a bonus to outpost production for outposts on that planet.
===========ID 0x0002E99D: There are numerous types of missions you can receive from the mission boards scattered across the Settled Systems. 

- Bounty - Find and kill a target, either in space or on the ground. 

- Cargo - Deliver cargo to a destination. 

- Passenger - Deliver passengers to a destination. 

- Hunt - Clear an area of hostile creatures. 

- Smuggling - A variant of cargo missions where you must smuggle contraband to a Crimson Fleet contact. This is only available at Crimson Fleet mission boards.

- Piracy - Steal cargo from a ship. Only available at Crimson Fleet mission boards.

- Steal - Steal items from a settlement and deliver them to the Key. Only available at Crimson Fleet mission boards.

- Explore - Find a planet in a system that has a specific planetary trait. For more info on finding planetary traits, see the "Surveying" entry.

- Supply - Provide resources to another settlement via an outpost cargo link. In order to start these missions, you must have the Outpost Engineering skill. To complete a supply mission, you'll need an outpost with a cargo link you can use to send a specified resource to the target settlement. The mission will complete once your outpost delivers enough of the resource to the settlement. For more information about settling up cargo links and how they work, see the "Outpost - Cargo Links" entry. 

- Survey - Explore and survey a planet. Planet survey missions require you to fully survey a target planet. This includes scanning all flora, fauna, resources, and landmarks. For more information on surveying, see the "Surveying" entry.
===========ID 0x0002E9A2: To create an outpost, you first need to place an outpost beacon. 

Find a place where you'd like to set up your outpost and press [Monocle]. Press [PlaceBeacon] to begin placing a beacon. To place the beacon, press [Confirm]. Once the beacon is placed, you can begin building and adding to your outpost. 

In Build Mode, use [LShoulder] and [RShoulder] to choose the category of what you want to build. You must have all of the necessary materials to build a module. With a module selected, choose where you'd like to build it, and press [Confirm] to build. To enter "flycam" mode, press [ToggleView] to get a bird's eye view of your outpost. This view can be helpful when building large structures.

Habs can be linked together and will automatically create a cohesive structure, and entrances into the different habs are automatically created. Windows can be added to walls by building a window structure and adding it to a wall of a hab.

You can move/delete modules with Modify mode. To change modes, press [Cancel]. Select a module with [Confirm] to move it around. You can delete any outpost object you built for a full refund of the building costs. You can change the color of some objects by highlighting them and pressing [LShoulder].

You can clear the building area by entering Clear mode. Move the clearing area around and press [Confirm] to remove rocks and other obstacles from the area.

Keep in mind that there is a limit to how many outpost beacons you can place. If you reach the limit, you will have to remove an outpost beacon to be able to place another one. You can remove an outpost by highlighting the outpost beacon and holding [XButton]. This will delete all outpost objects and give you a full refund of the build costs.
===========ID 0x0002E9A4: Although in bad repair, this old navigation beacon still has the projected flight plan of the Beagle. The next planned stop after Bel V is Zelazny I.

===========ID 0x0002EA0F: The officer in charge stated that his men have the remaining Terrormorph trapped on the tarmac - and Hadrian and I are to go find it. He can spare one Marine fireteam if we decide we want them.
===========ID 0x0002EA10: Another Terrormorph bites the dust! Now I just need to speak to the officer in charge at the spaceport.
===========ID 0x0002EA11: One of the Terrormorphs is attacking UC Security! We need to help!
===========ID 0x0002EA12: We've arrived at the spaceport. I need to find the officer in charge and let them know we're here to help.
===========ID 0x0002EA13: The President wants Hadrian and I down at the spaceport on the double! We need to take the elevator down to the NAT station now!
===========ID 0x0002EA14: Those people were mind-controlled by a Terrormorph... which means we're going to need to be extra careful down at the spaceport. We need to get down there on the double.
===========ID 0x0002EA15: The hostiles have been dealt with. I should talk to the guards to figure out what happened here.
===========ID 0x0002EA16: EM weapon collected! Time to put this hostile citizenry to sleep!
===========ID 0x0002EA17: I need to find an EM weapon so I can knock out these hostiles.
===========ID 0x0002EA18: A pair of UC Security officers appear to be under attack by... a group of UC citizens. We need to figure out what's going on here.
===========ID 0x0002EA19: The Cabinet was about to make their ruling on the Archives when there was some sort of explosion outside. I should listen in to hear what's going on.
===========ID 0x0002EA1A: The Cabinet was about to agree to help us access the Archives when there was some sort of explosion outside. I should listen in to hear what's going on.
===========ID 0x0002EA1B: The Cabinet's assembled and ready to hear what we have to say.
===========ID 0x0002EA1C: We've been summoned by the Cabinet to present our findings. Looks like we're heading to the Cabinet Chambers on the top floor of MAST.
===========ID 0x0002EA1D: Hadrian said she'll be waiting for me outside of MAST in New Atlantis.
===========ID 0x0002EA1F: I need to travel to <Alias=ChosenLocation> orbiting <Alias=ChosenPlanetLocation> in the <Alias=ChosenSystemLocation> System to plant an ARC device.
===========ID 0x0002EA4E: My investigation of the mercenary company called the First continues. After meeting with HopeTech's founder and CEO Ron Hope, I learned that the stolen HopeTech ship I found on Montara Luna was also spotted on Neon. Finding the starship thief is my best hope for tracking down the First and finding out why they're trying to seize farmland.
===========ID 0x0002EA4F: My investigation into the mercenary company called the First continues. After meeting with HopeTech's founder and CEO Ron Hope, I learned that the stolen ship was spotted on Neon.
===========ID 0x0002EA50: My investigation into the mercenary company called the First continues. In HopeTown, Ranger Nia Kalu has offered to introduce me to HopeTech's founder and CEO Ron Hope. I need to learn what he knows about the theft of the starship that the mercenaries on Montara Luna were using.
===========ID 0x0002EA51: My first assignment as a Freestar Ranger is to learn why the First mercenary company is threatening farmers. To do that, I'll need to find them. My best lead is the ship the mercs on Montara Luna were using, which was stolen from the HopeTech factory on Polvo.
===========ID 0x0002EA52: Now that I've collected my Freestar Ranger uniform and sidearm, I need to check back in with Marshal Blake at the Rock.
===========ID 0x0002EA53: I've been made a full-fledged Freestar Ranger, and now I need to collect my uniform and sidearm from the equipment locker in the Rock.
===========ID 0x0002EA54: When I described the men I encountered on Montara Luna to Ranger Diego Monroe, he said they fit the description of the First, a new mercenary group about which little is known. I need to take this information back to Marshal Blake at the Rock.
===========ID 0x0002EA55: After confronting mercenaries on Montara Luna who were trying to intimidate a farmer off her land, I'm returning to Akila City to report to Marshal Blake.
===========ID 0x0002EA77: My search for the First led me to Neon, where I tracked down Grace Early, the thief who stole the HopeTech starship I discovered on Montara Luna. From Grace I learned the names of two lieutenants in the First, Maya Cruz and Marco Graziani. She also gave me an encrypted slate, which I gave to Alex Shadid for analysis.
===========ID 0x0002EA91: Sam Coe and I had a deep talk in Akila City. He's in a better place now having resolved things with Lillian Hart.
===========ID 0x0002EA92: Lillian and Sam had a long overdue conversation and made a lot of progress. Sam said he wanted me to go to Akila City to have an important talk with him.
===========ID 0x0002EA93: It appears that Valerie Mosquera had expected Lillian, and there was never a "weapons cache" in the first place. It was clearly a scheme to draw out Lillian and end her on Andromas III. But now, Valerie and her Syndicate crews are dead. All that remains is to talk with Sam and Lillian.
===========ID 0x0002EA94: We have the location of Valerie Mosquera's secret cache on Andromas III. Lillian is certain when we get to the facility, it will trip an alarm and signal Valerie and her crew. We should head to Andromas III and prepare for the fight.
===========ID 0x0002EA95: Lillian Hart has been working a case against a very dangerous Syndicate operative named Valeria Mosquera. She needs to find the location of Valerie's cache - which should be on a smuggling ship named the Dumas. The Dumas itinerary has it at Rasalhague II.
===========ID 0x0002EA96: I've found Lillian Hart. Once we're safely aboard my ship, we should talk about her problems with the Syndicate.
===========ID 0x0002EA97: Lillian Hart is alive, for now, in Victor Compound. She's requesting Sam and I fight our way to her so she can break her cover and escape the Syndicate.
===========ID 0x0002EA98: Lillian Hart appears to be doing an undercover operation against the Seokguh Syndicate. So she's in danger. The papers indicate she's at "Victor Compound" on McClure II.
===========ID 0x0002EA99: Lillian Hart was working with a confidential informant. I have an address on where the CI lives in Ebbside.
===========ID 0x0002EA9A: I found a note about a Confidential Informant in Jaylen Pryce's office. I should read it and see if it has anything to do with Lillian Hart.
===========ID 0x0002EA9B: Another Ranger, Jaylen Pryce, wouldn't give us any information on Lillian Hart. But there's certainly some information we can find in Lillian's office.
===========ID 0x0002EA9C: Cora Coe is worried that she hasn't heard from her mother, Lillian Hart. She should be at the Freestar Ranger Outpost on Neon. We just need to find her mom, and she'll relax.
===========ID 0x0002EACE: Now that I've finished speaking with Delgado, I should find Mathis Castillo and hear what he has to say.
===========ID 0x0002EACF: With the shuttle bay cleared of all its lifeforms, I should now return to the Key using one of the Lock's shuttles.
===========ID 0x0002EAD0: After speaking with Delgado near the Lock's shuttle bay, I decided to include Mathis in the glory of discovering Kryx's Legacy despite his proposed betrayal. I should now speak to Mathis to gauge his reaction.
===========ID 0x0002EAD1: After speaking with Delgado near the Lock's shuttle bay, I decided to cut Mathis out of the Kryx's Legacy discovery in retribution for his proposed betrayal. I should now speak to Mathis to gauge his reaction.
===========ID 0x0002EAD2: Carter's locker had a slate listing a code that will allow us to access an escape tunnel excavated by Kryx and his compatriots. The same route he used to escape the prison might just provide us a way out as well.
===========ID 0x0002EAD3: After exploring Kryx's cell in D-Block, we discovered information about Kryx's Legacy - a plan regarding a GalBank transport carrying a fortune in credits and his plan for an escape from the Lock. Mathis and I will continue to follow in his footsteps.
===========ID 0x0002EAD5: We've canceled the lockdown on this section of the facility. We should now proceed to the cell block and continue hunting for more information regarding Kryx's Legacy.
===========ID 0x0002EAD6: Delgado has ordered Mathis and I to search for information regarding Kryx's Legacy on our own. Before we move on, we should find a way to release the lockdown in our section of the facility.
===========ID 0x0002EAD7: A surprise rockfall has separated Mathis and I from Delgado. It seems Mathis is taking this unique opportunity to suggest that we betray Delgado and sell any information about Kryx's Legacy to the highest bidder.
===========ID 0x0002EAD8: Delgado has noticed that we're locked into this initial area. He wants us to head up to a nearby control room to see if we can cancel the lockdown.
===========ID 0x0002EAD9: As we entered a particularly large area within the depths of the Lock, we were assaulted by predatory lifeforms. They've all been taken care of, so I should see what other surprises Delgado has in store for us.
===========ID 0x0002EADA: With the doors to the Lock unsealed, Delgado is having us head inside. I'll be happy to get out of Suvorov's freezing temperatures and into some cover.
===========ID 0x0002EADB: I've reached the exterior entrance to the Lock. I should speak to Delgado and see what he's planned next.
===========ID 0x0002EADC: I've rendezvoused with Delgado on Suvorov. Along with Mathis, a fellow Crimson Fleet rook, we're supposed to head to the entrance of the Lock.
===========ID 0x0002EADD: Now that I've landed on Suvorov, I should speak to Delgado and discover the next stage of our plan.
===========ID 0x0002EADE: Delgado has asked me to meet him on a planet called Suvorov - the supposed origin of Kryx's Legacy. Together we'll be exploring an supermax prison called "the Lock" in an effort to uncover information about the elusive treasure.
===========ID 0x0002EAFD: So Benjamin Bayu is now in charge of the whole Blend operation, but Yannick (and I) get to keep our heads... and still make some credits. Not ideal, but better than it could've been.
===========ID 0x0002EAFE: I've arrived at Yannick's shop with Neon Security posted outside. I've also been informed that the "boss" is expecting me. This does not sound good.
===========ID 0x0002EAFF: I found Neshar's contact - Robie Hennigar. She said that she's ready to resume smuggling Aurora for Yannick Legrande. I should report back the good news.
===========ID 0x0002EB00: I have to manufacture Aurora for Xenofresh until my shift ends. In order to maximize my pay, I should only take exactly the ingredients I need and keep moving as fast as possible. When I'm done, I can try to meet Neshar's contact in the break room.
===========ID 0x0002EB01: It looks like "Reilly Chernyshevsky" has got the job. Now I need to put on the clean suit and do what Valentina says.
===========ID 0x0002EB02: Yannick Legrande needs Aurora to brew his drink, "Blend." I have a forged ID for Reilly Chernyshevsky and I need to use it to get a job at Xenofresh Fisheries so I can find Neshar's contact.
===========ID 0x0002EB1E: Dalton has finished analyzing the information. I need to speak to him to see what he's discovered.
===========ID 0x0002EB1F: I need to wait for Dalton to analyze the data Nyx provided.
===========ID 0x0002EB20: I need to speak to Dalton about the data I've brought him for Directive Theta.
===========ID 0x0002EB21: I have the data that Dalton wanted as part of Directive Theta. I need to return to him at Ryujin Tower.
===========ID 0x0002EB22: Nyx finished analyzing the data and downloaded it onto a slate that I need to give to Dalton. I should talk to him about what he found.
===========ID 0x0002EB23: I need to wait for Nyx to analyze the data I gave him.
===========ID 0x0002EB24: I need to speak to Nyx at his apartment to hand back the program he gave me.
===========ID 0x0002EB25: Now that I've finished running Nyx's program, I need to return to him at his apartment and see what he can find.
===========ID 0x0002EB26: I need to enter Ryujin Industries and run the program Nyx gave me on Ularu's and Camden's computers.
===========ID 0x0002EB27: I need to enter Ryujin Industries and run the program Nyx gave me on Ularu's computer.
===========ID 0x0002EB28: I need to find an alternate way into Ryujin Tower since Dalton said my access to the elevators will be temporarily disabled. 
===========ID 0x0002EB29: I met Nyx at Madame Sauvage's Place. I need to speak to him to find out what I need to do for Directive Theta.
===========ID 0x0002EB2A: I need to meet a person named Nyx at Madame Sauvage's Place in Neon. He should already know that Directive Theta has been enacted.
===========ID 0x0002EB2B: I need to find Dalton Fiennes in his office on the Executive Floor and see what I can do to help find the mole at Ryujin Industries.
===========ID 0x0002EB33: I've successfully eliminated the target. I should check in with Vae Victis if I want to do any more... clean up work.
===========ID 0x0002EB34: Vae Victis has given me my target on <Alias=PlanetLocation>. I'm to track them down and kill them. He warned me to expect resistance.
===========ID 0x0002EB35: I've agreed to help Vae Victis eliminate a "threat" to the UC. He's directed me to collect the details from the transfer system.
===========ID 0x0002EC70: I returned to the Lodge in this universe. Now, the search for the Artifacts continues.
===========ID 0x0002EC71: I've been reborn in a new universe. I should head back to the Lodge and see if I can pick up the trail of the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002EC78: The beacon's been destroyed, so hopefully no more enemies will be incoming.
===========ID 0x0002EC79: I was access a beacon and it appears to have called hostile reinforcements. I need to take out the beacon or more enemies might show up.
===========ID 0x0002EC7E: I managed to take out the Spacer capital ship.
===========ID 0x0002EC7F: I encountered a massive Spacer capital ship. One of the toughest ships I've ever seen. It would take an amazing ship (probably with backup) to take it out.
===========ID 0x0002EC8E: Andy Singh has asked me to pick up a man named Tahir Vala, who has recently recovered from a serious illness. I picked him up and escorted him to Sub 17.
===========ID 0x0002EC8F: Andy Singh has asked me to pick up a man named Tahir Vala, who has recently recovered from a serious illness. I picked him up and escorted him to Sub 17.
===========ID 0x0002EC90: Andy Singh has asked me to pick up a man named Tahir Vala, who has recently recovered from a serious illness. I picked him up at the MedBay and can now escort him to Sub 17.
===========ID 0x0002EC91: Andy Singh has asked me to pick up a man named Tahir Vala, who has recently recovered from a serious illness. He's asked that I pick up a meal at Kay's for him, and then escort him to Sub 17.
===========ID 0x0002EC9B: Sergeant Yumi suspected a smuggler was bringing in goods through the spaceport. I investigated the matter and reported my findings to the Sergeant.
===========ID 0x0002EC9C: Sergeant Yumi suspected a smuggler was bringing in goods through the spaceport. I investigated the matter and reported my findings to the Sergeant.
===========ID 0x0002EC9D: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I investigated the matter and should report back to Sergeant Yumi.
===========ID 0x0002EC9E: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I worked the investigation and reported my findings to Sergeant Yumi. However, at the moment the spaceport is occupied by another ship.
===========ID 0x0002EC9F: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I worked the investigation and reported my findings to Sergeant Yumi.
===========ID 0x0002ECA0: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I worked the investigation and reported my findings to Sergeant Yumi.
===========ID 0x0002ECA1: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I obtained evidence from Agent Plato which will help me solve the case.
===========ID 0x0002ECA2: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I obtained the evidence I need to find the ship. I should report back to Sergeant Yumi and find out what comes next.
===========ID 0x0002ECA3: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I interviewed a port worker and should cross reference their testimony with information from Aegis.
===========ID 0x0002ECA4: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. He's asked me to interview a few port workers and cross reference their testimony with information from Aegis.
===========ID 0x0002ECA5: Sergeant Yumi suspects a smuggler is bringing in goods through the spaceport. I obtained evidence from Agent Plato which will help me solve the case.
===========ID 0x0002ECAD: The Va'ruun capital ship is no more. I've made the Settled Systems that much safer.
===========ID 0x0002ECAE: I've encountered a massive Va'ruun Zealot capital ship. Extremely dangerous. It's a threat to the Settled Systems, but unless my ship is similarly kitted out attacking it may be suicidal.
===========ID 0x0002ECFE: Barrett is back at the Lodge safe and sound. He's offered to join me on my travels in the future.
===========ID 0x0002ECFF: Barrett is free. I should take him back to the Lodge.
===========ID 0x0002ED00: Matsura, the pirate captain, is willing to let Barrett go in exchange for a ransom. I need to figure out a way to free Barrett.
===========ID 0x0002ED01: Heller survived, but Barrett has been captured by the Crimson Fleet again. I need to find him.
===========ID 0x0002ED02: I have the coordinates that should take me to the pirate ship that captured Barrett and Heller.
===========ID 0x0002ED03: I found a transmission from Barrett! Lin needs to hear about this.
===========ID 0x0002ED04: Barrett is gone, captured by pirates. My only hope is that there might be some clue on where they went on the broken computer in the comms building.
===========ID 0x0002ED05: Argos Extractors is packing up operations on Vectera, but there's no word about Barrett. I need to go there and find out what happened.
===========ID 0x0002ED2A: I've resolved the situation with Karl Fielding. I should return to Adler Kemp with the news once I ensure I am not being pursued by security or anyone else in Cydonia.
===========ID 0x0002ED2B: Before Adler Kemp will trust me enough to join the Crimson Fleet, he wants me to do a favor for him first - namely to shake down a deadbeat named Karl Fielding. Karl is somewhere near the Deimos Miners Quarters deep in Cydonia.
===========ID 0x0002ED2C: I've caught the attention of an organization which has asked me to make contact with someone named Adler Kemp. I'm hoping it's the Crimson Fleet, but I'll need to head to the Broken Spear to confirm.
===========ID 0x0002ED2D: Saoirse Bowden has indicated that Adler Kemp is the local Crimson Fleet contact and would possibly accept the crate of Aurora as a "buy in" to join their ranks. I can find him at the Broken Spear Bar.
===========ID 0x0002ED2E: My first mission is to proceed to Cydonia and make contact with Saoirse Bowden at the Trade Authority. UC SysDef has provided me with a crate of Aurora to sell as a "buy in" to the Crimson Fleet.
===========ID 0x0002ED2F: I've obtained a mysterious slate from a stranger. I should read the slate and see why it was delivered to me.
===========ID 0x0002ED30: After refusing to accept Commander Ikande's offer, I've decided to seek out the Crimson Fleet on my own and potentially join their ranks.
===========ID 0x0002ED31: I've successfully escaped from the UC Vigilance. Now that UC SysDef has become my enemy, I need to seek out the Crimson Fleet - my only hope of potentially staying alive.
===========ID 0x0002ED32: I've started a fight aboard the UC Vigilance. My only option now is to escape.
===========ID 0x0002ED33: Commander Ikande has outlined the parameters of my mission and has asked me to speak to his second-in-command, Lieutenant Jillian Toft.
===========ID 0x0002ED34: I should speak to Commander Ikande to begin my mission briefing.
===========ID 0x0002ED35: I've arrived aboard the UC Vigilance. I should speak to and then follow the SysDef Guard at the docking port so they can presumably lead me to Commander Ikande.
===========ID 0x0002ED36: Commander Tuala of the UC Vanguard has provided me with an assignment. I am to report to the UC Vigilance and speak to Commander Kibwe Ikande for the details.
===========ID 0x0002ED37: Commander Kibwe Ikande of UC SysDef asked me to join his crusade against the Crimson Fleet. Not wanting to undertake this fool's errand, I've declined his offer.
===========ID 0x0002ED38: Commander Kibwe Ikande of UC SysDef has asked me to join his crusade against the Crimson Fleet. Seeing no real alternative, I've decided to accept his offer. I now have to follow the UC Security Guard and attend a briefing on my first mission.
===========ID 0x0002ED39: I've been arrested for committing a crime in UC space. Instead of being sent to prison, I've been placed in an interrogation room aboard a UC spaceship.
===========ID 0x0002ED81: Milk that has been ultra-pasteurized for maximum freshness.
===========ID 0x0002ED82: Oishii brand sushi rolls. Snack-sized.

===========ID 0x0002ED8D: Tranquilitea's lemon-flavored tea.
===========ID 0x0002ED8F: Boxed meal kit.
===========ID 0x0002EE59: Hey kiddo,

I know this is your first flight, and I just want to wish you luck, and give you some words of advice. Because the truth is, I'm worried. Not about your safety, your mother has that department cornered. 

I'm worried the poets are wrong, and the cynics are right. I'm worried that when you finally live your dream of going to space, that you won't like it.

See, when you were a kid, all you did was wait. You had to wait for school to end so you could watch those space cartoons. You had to wait for your birthday before we bought you that toy spaceship. But most days, you spent waiting until you were old enough. Old enough to take your first piloting lessons, get your first ship, and join your first crew.

Now that you're finally old enough, I'm worried. Because if being a kid is full of waiting, being an adult is about disappointment. It's about getting what you always wanted, only to wonder, is that all there is?

Well, I'm here to tell you, screw the cynics. There are things in life worth waiting for. You and your mother were that for me. I'm hoping and praying this job is that for you.

Shoot for the stars kiddo. We'll be here when you touch back down.
 
Dad

===========ID 0x0002EF75: A ship's scanner receives vast amounts of data, but it takes a trained mind to efficiently analyze it all.
===========ID 0x0002EF9F: I got a job at Ryujin Industries along with my very first promotion. I'm now officially a junior operative working for Imogene Salzo.
===========ID 0x0002EFA0: I've spoken and delivered coffee to the people Imogene wanted me to meet in the conference room. I should return to her office and find out what's next.
===========ID 0x0002EFA1: Imogene promoted me to junior operative for handling Tomo at the TerraBrew, but I still have to deliver the coffee and meet the executives in the conference room.
===========ID 0x0002EFA2: I finally have the coffee order. I need to return to Ryujin Tower and talk to Imogene.
===========ID 0x0002EFA3: I was able to deal with Tomo, the man who held me at gunpoint. Now, I still need to pick up the coffee order and get back to Ryujin Tower.
===========ID 0x0002EFA4: While picking up the Ryujin coffee order, a  man approached me at gun point. I need to deal with this situation by either talking him down or taking him out.
===========ID 0x0002EFA5: I got a job! My first order of business is to pick up a coffee order at the nearby TerraBrew.
===========ID 0x0002EFA6: I should complete my interview with Imogene.
===========ID 0x0002EFA7: I've arrived at my interview and Imogene has asked me to take a seat.
===========ID 0x0002EFA8: Lane led me to Imogene Salzo's office. It's time to start my interview with Imogene Salzo.
===========ID 0x0002EFA9: I spoke to the receptionist, Lane, on the Operations floor, and he offered to take me to Imogene Salzo's office. I should allow him to show me the way.
===========ID 0x0002EFAA: I arrived at the Operations floor in Ryujin Tower. I could speak to the receptionist that greeted me, or find Imogene Salzo's office myself.
===========ID 0x0002EFAB: I filled out an application at a Ryujin Industries kiosk and qualified for an interview. I need to travel to Ryujin Tower in Neon and meet with Imogene Salzo on the Operations floor.
===========ID 0x0002EFAC: I filled out an application at a Ryujin Industries kiosk and qualified for an interview. I need to travel to Ryujin Tower in Neon and meet with Imogene Salzo on the Operations floor. Neon is on Volii Alpha in the Volii System.
===========ID 0x0002EFAD: While roaming the city, I heard a job advertisement for Ryujin Industries. I should find a Ryujin kiosk nearby if I'd like to apply for the job.
===========ID 0x0002EFD6: We were ambushed by a group calling themselves the Starborn. We'll need to speak to the other members of Constellation about this.
===========ID 0x0002EFD7: Our ordeal with Slayton is over and we're finally free to leave Neon and get the Artifact back to the Lodge.
===========ID 0x0002EFD8: Slayton has impounded my ship at Neon's spaceport. I'll need to confront him and get him to free my ship before we can leave.
===========ID 0x0002EFD9: We were ambushed by an agent from Slayton Aerospace, the original owner of the Artifact. We should get out of Neon quickly.
===========ID 0x0002EFDA: We have the Artifact. Time to leave.
===========ID 0x0002EFDB: I found the seller. Time to meet with him and Walter.
===========ID 0x0002EFDC: The seller will have a large security briefcase and will respond to the code phrase "Ramsay and Travers."
===========ID 0x0002EFDD: I need to head over to the Astral Lounge and find the person selling the Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002EFDE: I should talk to Walter about what I've found, and let him know we're ready to meet the seller.
===========ID 0x0002EFDF: Walter and Issa want me to investigate the seller and case the Astral Lounge. The seller was connected to us by James Newill. The Astral Lounge is in the Trade Tower.
===========ID 0x0002EFE0: Walter needs to head to the Stroud-Eklund offices here on Neon before we can meet with our Artifact seller.
===========ID 0x0002EFE1: Walter has asked me to come with him to Neon, where he intends to purchase an Artifact. He'll be riding as a passenger in my ship until we get there.
===========ID 0x0002EFE2: Walter has asked me to come with him to Neon, where he intends to purchase an Artifact. I'll need to tell him when I'm ready to head out.
===========ID 0x0002EFE3: Walter Stroud wants to talk to me.
===========ID 0x0002F03A: Genghis Khan and the Renegades now have control over the Facility. Undoubtedly they'll soon be able to leave Crucible and finally be free.
===========ID 0x0002F03B: Amanirenas and the Believers now have control over the Facility. Amanrenas can determine the criteria for passing the test and being able to leave Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F03C: FDR and the Pragmatists now have control over the Facility. The clones will start standing on their own two feet before they can leave Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F03D: I initiated a full cleansing at the Facility. All of the clones on Charybdis III have been destroyed.
===========ID 0x0002F03E: I rebooted the Facility and set it to its default settings. So none of the Societies will win.
===========ID 0x0002F03F: I reached the heart of the Facility and have rebooted the system. I should report back to Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F040: Ada Lovelace successfully decrypted the Security Override Code. Now there is nothing left to do except go into the heart of the Facility and determine the fate of Crucible and its clones.
===========ID 0x0002F041: The conflict between the Societies in Crucible is over. Now I should see if Ada Lovelace can decrypt the Security Override Code so I can return to the Facility.
===========ID 0x0002F042: I helped Genghis Khan win his battle. Now there's nothing left to do except go to the Facility and resolve the situation in Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F043: The Societies are on the brink of war. I must resolve the situation before I can get the Security Override Code decrypted.
===========ID 0x0002F044: I helped Amanirenas win her battle. Now there's nothing left to do except go to the Facility and resolve the situation in Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F045: The Societies are on the brink of war. I must resolve the situation before I can get the Security Override Code decrypted.
===========ID 0x0002F046: I helped FDR win his battle. Now there's nothing left to do except go to the Facility and resolve the situation in Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F047: The Societies are on the brink of war. I must resolve the situation before I can get the Security Override Code decrypted.
===========ID 0x0002F048: I've received an emergency message on Crucible. I'm being asked to hold off going to the Facility and go back there.
===========ID 0x0002F049: I have found an Encrypted Security Override Code. The encryption is beyond me, but perhaps Ada Lovelace could help with it.
===========ID 0x0002F04A: I've docked with the Beagle. Hopefully I can find a Security Passcode here that will help me unlock the Facility.
===========ID 0x0002F04B: I have found a beacon left by the Beagle long ago. If I follow the Beacons, I'll find the ship.
===========ID 0x0002F04C: Ada Lovelace said that the Facility's automated astronomy equipment resets and points to Bel V every day. Perhaps that's where the Beagle is?
===========ID 0x0002F04D: The Security Passcode that will open up the rest of the Facility may be on a sister spaceship called the Beagle. Ada Lovelace may be able to provide a way to find the Beagle.
===========ID 0x0002F04E: The clones of Crucible at one point lived in the Facility. The Facility was destroyed when a previous version of Genghis Khan reached the surface then the hostile wildlife murdered them all. There is a section of the Facility that is blocked off, but I need a Security Passcode to proceed. I should report back to one of the leaders.
===========ID 0x0002F04F: I've arrived at the mysterious Facility. I should be able to learn more and perhaps see if there's a way to help one of the Societies.
===========ID 0x0002F050: The situation on Crucible is bad and getting worse. The Facility that maintains Crucible is breaking down. It is located somewhere else on Charybdis II and it's where the robots come from. Each of these Societies seem to want me to do something there.
===========ID 0x0002F051: Crucible is a settlement full of clones! Franklin Roosevelt said I should speak to the heads of the other Societies here: Amanirenas and Genghis Khan.
===========ID 0x0002F052: Ada said that I should speak to Franklin to learn more about Crucible.
===========ID 0x0002F053: I've landed near Crucible. There is a robot waiting to talk to me.
===========ID 0x0002F054: I've received a curious distress call saying that a place called Crucible on Charybdis III needs help.

===========ID 0x0002F0A4: I need to make my way to the High Energy Research Lab.
===========ID 0x0002F0A5: I need to take the elevator down to the Research Level.
===========ID 0x0002F0A6: I need to tell the Director we found a way to control the shifting.
===========ID 0x0002F0A7: I need to tell Maria what happened in the other universe.
===========ID 0x0002F0A8: I need to find a Probe Control Unit and use it to shift back to the other universe.
===========ID 0x0002F0A9: I need to work with Maria to find a way to control the shifting.
===========ID 0x0002F0AA: I need to find a way through the facility to Maria's lab.

===========ID 0x0002F0B2: I need to speak to the Director of Nishina Research Station about the Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F0B3: I need to speak to the Director of Nishina Research Station about the Artifact and the distress signal.
===========ID 0x0002F0B4: I picked up a distress signal from the facility where the Artifact should be. I need to investigate.
===========ID 0x0002F0C0: I have all the Artifacts that the Eye has been able to find.
===========ID 0x0002F0C1: Vladimir has given me locations he believes could hold Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F0C2: I found a facility where the Artifact should be. I need to investigate.
===========ID 0x0002F0C3: I picked up a distress signal from the facility where the Artifact should be. I need to investigate.
===========ID 0x0002F0C4: I've picked up a distress signal.
===========ID 0x0002F0C5: Vladimir has given me locations he believes could hold Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F0C6: I need to meet with Vladimir Sall about finding more Artifacts in the fringes of space.
===========ID 0x0002F0C7: I should return to the Lodge and tell them what I've learned about the Unity.
===========ID 0x0002F0CA: A bartender told me someone heard some sort of distress call in the Charybdis system. Might be worth checking out.
===========ID 0x0002F0E7: I helped resolve the situation between Rivkah and her father. Hopefully now, Rivkah can get the help she needs.
===========ID 0x0002F0E8: I can't seem to find Rivkah anywhere. Maybe Trevor knows where she is?
===========ID 0x0002F0E9: I need to return to Rivkah in Cydonia and update her on what happened with her father.
===========ID 0x0002F0EA: I tried to intimidate Natan into leaving Rivkah alone, but it went poorly, and true to Rivkah's word, Natan is stubborn and aggressive. I need to kill him before he kills me.
===========ID 0x0002F0EB: I've found Natan. Now, to speak with him and try to resolve this situation with Rivkah, one way or another.
===========ID 0x0002F0EC: I went to the Hotel Volii. Natan is staying in one of the rooms, I just need to figure out which one.
===========ID 0x0002F0ED: According to Rivkah, Natan should be staying at The Hotel Volii in Neon. I need to go there and try to find him.
===========ID 0x0002F0EE: Rivkah says that I can help smooth things over with her father, Natan, by bringing a peace offering: a bottle of rare Red Harvest Reserve Whiskey. A local bartender, Jack, may know where I can get some.
===========ID 0x0002F0FE: With the Ashta disturbance not being the fault of Keoni's sensors, Davis Wilson is starting to see the light that Keoni's research may bear fruit. Time will tell.
===========ID 0x0002F0FF: Bailey Kirklin confessed to commandeering the robot in order to discredit Keoni Alpin. She did it to protect her boss, but I'm not sure he's going to appreciate it. I should talk with Davis Wilson.
===========ID 0x0002F100: The security terminal shows that Bailey Kirklin is behind the robot that riled up the Ashta. I should confront her about why she did it.
===========ID 0x0002F101: Davis Wilson said that there is a terminal that would've had to be used to control the security robot that was agitating the Ashta. Hopefully I can find some clue who is responsible there.
===========ID 0x0002F102: We survived an attack by the Ashta. A security robot was tampered with to rile them. I should talk with Davis Wilson about it.
===========ID 0x0002F103: Davis Wilson and I are trying to figure out what has the Ashta behaving badly by tracking them outside the Akila City walls.
===========ID 0x0002F104: Davis Wilson is concerned about the Ashta behaving strangely and he wants me to help him find answers by tracking them. I need to meet him at the East Gate.
===========ID 0x0002F105: Keoni's data is highly unusual, and she needs me to talk with Davis Wilson about it.
===========ID 0x0002F106: Keoni Alpin should have her data from the seismic sensors. I should go talk to her.
===========ID 0x0002F107: Keoni Alpin now has her seismic sensors set up and has the processing power to analyze the data. She said she might have some findings tomorrow.
===========ID 0x0002F111: The decision has been made - we're deploying the microbe to sterilize the Heatleeches and Terrormorphs - and I've been made a "Class One Citizen" of the United Colonies. I've been directed to speak to Commander Tuala to receive my next assignment - and my rewards.
===========ID 0x0002F112: The decision has been made - we're deploying the microbe to clean up the Terrormorphs - and I've been made a "Class One Citizen" of the United Colonies. I've been directed to speak to Commander Tuala to receive my next assignment - and my rewards.
===========ID 0x0002F113: The decision has been made - we're deploying the Aceles to clean up the Terrormorphs - and I've been made a "Class One Citizen" of the United Colonies. I've been directed to speak to Commander Tuala to receive my next assignment - and my rewards.
===========ID 0x0002F114: I lied to Hadrian and Percival and told them that Dr. Orlase was responsible for the attacks. Now, it's time we addressed the Cabinet.
===========ID 0x0002F115: I've told Hadrian and Percival the truth - that Vae Victis is responsible for the attacks. Now it's time to address the Cabinet.
===========ID 0x0002F116: I confronted Vae Victis and he confessed. He organized the attacks on New Atlantis and Tau Ceti as part of a plot to undo the damage done to the Sanon family name. But now, I have a choice: share the truth that Vae Victis is responsible or pin the blame on Reginald Orlase.
===========ID 0x0002F117: What we learned at Londinion suggests the Terrormorph attack on New Atlantis might've been intentional. Our only lead, though, is Vae Victis. I need to talk to him and find out what he might know.
===========ID 0x0002F12E: I tracked down smuggling ringleader and senior First member Marco Graziani, To learn his location, I had to run the dangerous Red Mile. After that I traveled to Codos and confronted Marco aboard his ship. I obtained an encrypted slate and turned it over to Ranger Alex Shadid for analysis.
===========ID 0x0002F12F: I confronted smuggling ringleader and senior First member Marco Graziani. Marco was unwilling to surrender himself and a fight broke out. Now that Marco is dead, I need to find evidence aboard his ship that might reveal the First's plans and the location of their hideout.
===========ID 0x0002F130: While tracking smuggling ringleader and senior First member Marco Graziani, I met with Mei Devine, owner of the Red Mile cantina. She told me that Marco was on Codos, waiting aboard his ship to meet with me. All that's left is to confront him.
===========ID 0x0002F131: While tracking smuggling ringleader and senior First member Marco Graziani, I met with Mei Devine, owner of the Red Mile cantina. I agreed to run the Red Mile in exchange for Marco's location, and now I'm waiting as Mei sends a message to let him know I'm coming.
===========ID 0x0002F132: While tracking smuggling ringleader and senior First member Marco Graziani, I met with Mei Devine, owner of the Red Mile cantina.

===========ID 0x0002F14A: I found Imogene in the Seokguh Syndicate hideout. She had evidence to prove Ularu is the mole, but Dalton needs time to examine it. 
===========ID 0x0002F14B: I briefly stopped to talk to Yuko. I need to either report to Dalton or go confront Ularu.
===========ID 0x0002F14C: I briefly stopped to speak to Yuko. I really need to report to Dalton now.
===========ID 0x0002F14D: On my way to Dalton, I ran into Yuko. I could give her an update on my current assignment if I feel like talking to her or continue on to Dalton.
===========ID 0x0002F14E: On my way to Dalton, I ran into Yuko. I could give her an update on my current assignment if I feel like talking to her or continue on to Dalton or Ularu.
===========ID 0x0002F14F: I need to return to Dalton and give him the slate.
===========ID 0x0002F150: I confronted Imogene and found Kumiho's slate. I need to deliver it to Benjamin Bayu before heading back to Ryujin Tower.

===========ID 0x0002F153: I agreed to help Ularu who admitted to leaking Project Dominion as part of her plan to overthrow Masako. I still need to report to Dalton but also make sure he believes Imogene is guilty.
===========ID 0x0002F154: I need to return to Dalton and give him the slate. Imogene was collecting evidence against Ularu. Perhaps I should confront her.
===========ID 0x0002F155: I found Imogene. Now all I have left to do is find Kumiho's slate for Benjamin Bayu.
===========ID 0x0002F156: Imogene is dead. I need to search her body for evidence, and then find Kumiho's slate for Benjamin Bayu.
===========ID 0x0002F157: Imogene is dead. I need to search her body for evidence.
===========ID 0x0002F158: I need to kill Imogene. Once that's done, I need to find Kumiho's slate for Benjamin Bayu.
===========ID 0x0002F159: I need to kill Imogene.
===========ID 0x0002F15A: Imogene claims she's innocent but will not return with me. I either need to trust her or kill her. Then I need to find Kumiho's slate for Administrator Bayu.
===========ID 0x0002F15B: Imogene claims she's innocent but will not return with me. I either need to trust her or kill her.
===========ID 0x0002F15C: I found Imogene in the Seokguh Syndicate's hideout. I need to confront her about being the mole and bring her in to Dalton. Then I need to find Kumiho's slate for Benjamin Bayu.
===========ID 0x0002F15D: I found Imogene in the Seokguh Syndicate's hideout. I need to confront her about being the mole and bring her in to Dalton.
===========ID 0x0002F15E: I found Kumiho's slate. All I have left to do is search Imogene's body for any evidence I could bring to Dalton.
===========ID 0x0002F15F: I found Kumiho's slate. All I have left to do is finish confronting Imogene.
===========ID 0x0002F160: I found Kumiho's slate. All I have left to do is now is find Imogene and bring her back for questioning.
===========ID 0x0002F161: I finally made it inside the Seokguh Syndicate hideout. I need to find Imogene and bring her back to Ryujin Industries for questioning. Then I need to find Kumiho's slate for Administrator Bayu. He warned me she wouldn't be friendly if I got caught.
===========ID 0x0002F162: I finally made it inside the Seokguh Syndicate hideout. I need to find Imogene and bring her back to Ryujin Industries for questioning.
===========ID 0x0002F163: Frankie wasn't about to let me into the Seokguh Syndicate hideout. I need to find another way to get inside.
===========ID 0x0002F164: Frankie gave me access to the Seokguh Syndicate's hideout so I can finally go inside.
===========ID 0x0002F165: Frankie gave me access to the Seokguh Syndicate's hideout so I can finally go inside.
===========ID 0x0002F166: I made it to Frankie's Grab & Go. I need to speak to Frankie to gain access to the Seokguh Syndicate hideout to find Imogene.
===========ID 0x0002F167: I got Benjamin Bayu's approval to enter the Seokguh Syndicate hideout. I can head to Frankie's Grab & Go now and speak to Frankie herself about getting inside to finally find Imogene.
===========ID 0x0002F169: Yuko told me Imogene was last seen at Frankie's Grab & Go. She strongly suggested I speak to Benjamin Bayu about getting permission to enter since Frankie's is a Seokguh Syndicate hideout.
===========ID 0x0002F16A: Dalton wants me to speak to Benjamin Bayu before I enter Frankie's Grab & Go to find Imogene. Since Bayu has ties to the Seokguh Syndicate and Frankie's is Syndicate territory, it's important to get his approval.
===========ID 0x0002F16B: Yuko told me Imogene was last seen at Frankie's Grab & Go, but she strongly suggested I speak to Dalton before trying to find her.
===========ID 0x0002F16C: While looking for Imogene in her office, Yuko noticed I was searching for her. I should see if she knows where Imogene is.

===========ID 0x0002F2EE: The situation with Helena, Bonifc, and Maldonado has been resolved at long last.
===========ID 0x0002F2EF: I've saved Bonifc and acquired the missing data. Time to head back to Helena and tell her the good news.
===========ID 0x0002F2F0: Maldonado's dead. I should check him for the stolen data.
===========ID 0x0002F2F1: Bonifc is dead. Time for me to head back to Helena and "inform" her about what happened here.
===========ID 0x0002F2F2: I've refused Maldonado's offer to keep the slate, which he's not taking well. He's attacked Bonifc and I. I should probably deal with that.
===========ID 0x0002F2F3: I've decided to accept Maldonado's deal - let him keep the slate and kill Bonifc in exchange for a pile of credits. Bonifc doesn't seem like he likes that plan. Guess we'll just have to put him down.
===========ID 0x0002F2F4: Bonifc and I have found Maldonado... but he seems like he wants to make me an offer. I should listen to what he has to say.
===========ID 0x0002F2F5: I've saved Bonifc and the data. Time to head back to Helena and tell her the good news.
===========ID 0x0002F2F6: It seems Bonifc was kidnapped by a man named "Maldonado" who planned to frame him for stealing the data. Now Bonifc and I are going to track him down and get Reliant's data back.
===========ID 0x0002F2F7: I've found Bonifc - tied up and surrounded by mercenaries. I should talk to him and find out what's happened.
===========ID 0x0002F2F8: I've agreed to help Helena Strickland track down her stolen data. She believes the key to find it is one of her employees - Bonifc Maksimov - whose ship she tracked to the nearby planet of Hawley. I need to find him.
===========ID 0x0002F32D: I have the final Artifact. The Unity awaits.
===========ID 0x0002F32E: I have reached the Buried Temple. It's time to claim the final Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F32F: There seems to be a military base built over the Buried Temple. I'll need to get through the base in order to reach the final Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F330: I have arrive in orbit over Masada III. I'll need to fight through the Starborn ships to reach the surface.
===========ID 0x0002F331: I must go to the Buried Temple on Masada III, where I will confront the Hunter, the Emissary, and their allies for the final Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F332: I must go to the Buried Temple on Masada III, where I will confront the Emissary and their allies for the final Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F333: I must go to the Buried Temple on Masada III, where I will confront the Hunter and his allies for the final Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F39E: Constellation has a new rival in our search for the Artifacts. Who are the Starborn and how much do they know?
===========ID 0x0002F39F: The meeting at the Lodge is over. I should add the Artifact to the collection before I head out.
===========ID 0x0002F3A0: Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss this Starborn ship that ambushed us.
===========ID 0x0002F3A1: We've survived our encounter with the Starborn. We need to head back to the Lodge and tell everyone what happened.
===========ID 0x0002F3A2: We've been ambushed by a group calling themselves the Starborn. They're demanding we surrender the Artifact.
===========ID 0x0002F3E0: I returned to the Lodge in this universe. Now, the search for the Artifacts continues.
===========ID 0x0002F3E1: I've been reborn in a new universe. I should head back to the Lodge and see if I can pick up the trail of the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F3E2: I brought the Artifact to Constellation, and now they want me to join. Sarah Morgan, the Chair of Constellation, is asking me to come with her on a mission.
===========ID 0x0002F3E3: Barrett wants me to take the Artifact to his colleagues in Constellation. I'll have his ship, the Frontier, and his robot Vasco for the journey.
===========ID 0x0002F3E4: We survived the pirate attack. I should check with our client, Barrett, and the others to see if they're okay.
===========ID 0x0002F3E5: Pirates are attacking us! We need to fend them off.
===========ID 0x0002F3E6: Pirates are attacking us! We need to fend them off.
===========ID 0x0002F3E7: Whatever I found in the mine knocked me out cold. Now whoever paid for this whole operation is making a landing, and we need to meet him.
===========ID 0x0002F3E8: It's my second outing with Argos Extractors. I'm following Supervisor Lin around today while she oversees the dig site, doing whatever tasks she has for me.

===========ID 0x0002F5DB: You can easily move cargo between your outpost and ship by building a Transfer Container. Only one can be built at an outpost.

Building a Transfer Container lets you easily transfer cargo between your ship and outpost by using your ship's transfer menu. Without a Transfer Container, this is not possible. 

You can fill the Transfer container like other storage containers as well. To fill the Transfer Container, create output links to it from builders, extractors, containers, or cargo links. See the "Outpost - Output Links" entry for more details.

===========ID 0x0002F620: Humanity now has access to untold alien worlds, and the ability to decipher all that data while on the ground has become an essential skillset.
===========ID 0x0002F657: I need to head to NASA, on Earth, and find the Artifact there once again.
===========ID 0x0002F658: The Emissary wants me to search Earth's Moon for a secret connected to the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F659: The Emissary wants me to search Earth's Moon for a secret connected to the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F65A: I've spoken to the Hunter and the Emissary once again. The search for the Artifacts continues.
===========ID 0x0002F65B: I've spoken to the Starborn and learned that the Unity is a gateway to parallel universes. I should ask any other questions I have before I leave.
===========ID 0x0002F65C: I have arrived at Oborum III. Time to speak to the Hunter and the Emissary.
===========ID 0x0002F65D: I have arrived at Oborum III. The Hunter's ship, the Scorpius, is here. Time to get answers.
===========ID 0x0002F675: The Emissary and the Hunter have demanded I choose sides in their war over the Artifacts. There will be a battle at a place called the Buried Temple.
===========ID 0x0002F676: I need to gather any remaining Artifacts that Constellation has uncovered. Once I have them, the Starborn will be waiting at the Buried Temple.
===========ID 0x0002F677: I have the Artifact from Earth, but the Emissary and Hunter have arrived on the surface and want to talk.
===========ID 0x0002F678: The original Grav Drive was based around an Artifact. The Artifact is still here, connected to the prototype Grav Drive.
===========ID 0x0002F679: The first Grav Drive was developed with the help of NASA, on Earth. I need to find out how this is connected with the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F67A: The first Grav Drive was developed with the help of NASA, on Earth. I need to find out how this is connected with the Artifacts.
===========ID 0x0002F67B: The Emissary has given me a key to a base on Luna, Earth's Moon, saying I'll learn more about the Artifacts if I investigate.
===========ID 0x0002F6A3: Now that the Terrormorph data is in Hadrian's hands, Deputy MacIntyre has stated there's someone who has asked to speak to me. I'm to proceed down to Subsection Seven to find them.
===========ID 0x0002F6A4: Time to speak to Deputy MacIntyre about becoming a UC citizen! Though it sounds like there might be something else we need to discuss as well.
===========ID 0x0002F6A5: Sounds like Deputy MacIntyre has a couple things she wants to discuss - including becoming a citizen. She's asked me to follow her.
===========ID 0x0002F6A6: Deputy MacIntyre's directed me to hand the data over to Hadrian. I should speak to her.
===========ID 0x0002F6A7: I've now got the data in hand. Time to return to Deputy MacIntyre.
===========ID 0x0002F6A8: All codes verified. Time to collect the data.
===========ID 0x0002F6A9: I need to deposit the three codes into the code receptacles to get them verified. Only then will I be allowed inside the Archives.
===========ID 0x0002F6AA: The United Colonies Archival Monitor has asked me to approach her station.
===========ID 0x0002F6AB: Deputy MacIntyre has given me the last code and directed me to the Archives - across the plaza from MAST.
===========ID 0x0002F6AC: I've acquired the House Va'ruun code piece. Now I should head back to the Freestar Embassy and try and convince them to hand over theirs.
===========ID 0x0002F6AD: I've got both codes in hand. Time to return to Deputy MacIntyre to collect the UC's Archival Code.
===========ID 0x0002F6AE: I've got Bal'mor's biometric key. Now I can go collect the code piece myself.
===========ID 0x0002F6AF: I've convinced Bal'mor to help our cause. I just need to follow him to collect my code.
===========ID 0x0002F6B0: I found Ambassador Bal'mor, alive and kicking. He invited me to speak to him.
===========ID 0x0002F6B1: Both robots are dead and an old man's come out from a chamber on this floor. Could he be Ambassador Bal'mor?
===========ID 0x0002F6B2: There are combat robots on the hunt down here! I should take them out!
===========ID 0x0002F6B3: I approached another intercom in the basement, but this one had a warning about "guardians." I guess I should be cautious as I proceed inside...
===========ID 0x0002F6B4: Looks like we've got more power. The voice now seems to have moved down towards the basement. I should follow.
===========ID 0x0002F6B5: The voice led me to yet another power switch. Sounds like I should throw this one as well.
===========ID 0x0002F6B6: Another power switch down. This time, though, it sounds like the voice has moved towards the basement. I should follow.
===========ID 0x0002F6B7: Another power switch down. Once I threw it, though, the voice moved to a different spot in the embassy. Guess I should follow.
===========ID 0x0002F6B8: Another intercom, another power switch. Guess I should throw this one too.
===========ID 0x0002F6B9: It sounds like the voice has moved somewhere deeper inside the embassy. I think I'm supposed to follow.
===========ID 0x0002F6BA: Ah ha. There we go. The door into the embassy unlocked. The voice then suggested I continue to follow it deeper into the embassy... I think?
===========ID 0x0002F6BB: I think someone's speaking to me through a broken intercom. I'm not exactly sure what they said, but it sounds like they want me to throw the nearby power switch.
===========ID 0x0002F6BC: A crackling voice just beckoned me towards the nearby intercom. I should go check it out.
===========ID 0x0002F6BD: I've now got both codes in hand. Time to speak to Deputy MacIntyre to collect the UC's Archival Code.
===========ID 0x0002F6BE: I got the Freestar Archival Code! Now I just need the Va'ruun code. Time to speak to Ambassador Bal'mor.
===========ID 0x0002F6BF: The report Deputy MacIntyre gave me suggests that there's a back entrance into Radcliff's quarters through a utility area in the main conference room. Should make it easier for me to enter her chambers unnoticed and access that listening device.
===========ID 0x0002F6C0: Cameron's given me directions on how to enter Radcliff's quarters undetected - through the utility section accessible through the main conference room - and the key to unlock the door.
===========ID 0x0002F6C1: It seems Radcliff's assistant - Mr. Long - feels like he's being underused and I've convinced him he should work with me instead. He's agreed to hear me out and has directed me to follow him somewhere a bit more private.
===========ID 0x0002F6C2: Deputy MacIntyre's agreed to permit the Freestar observers to monitor all research done with the Terrormorph data. Now I just need to let Radcliff know.
===========ID 0x0002F6C3: I've convinced Radcliff to hand over her Archival Code. She's directed me to follow her.
===========ID 0x0002F6C4: Radcliff's demanded that Freestar monitors observe all research done with the Terrormorph data... but I'm not comfortable agreeing to that without MacIntyre's say-so. I need to run this by her first.
===========ID 0x0002F6C5: Well, well. It seems the Ambassador had some plans to get rid of one of the members of the Freestar Council of Governors. This should help me to convince her to aid our cause. I need to confront her.
===========ID 0x0002F6C6: I wasn't able to convince Ambassador Radcliff to help us. Looks like I'll need to find some other way to get her to play ball. Time to access that listening device.
===========ID 0x0002F6C7: I wasn't able to convince Ambassador Radcliff to help us. Looks like I'll need to find some other way to get her to play ball. Time to find that listening device and speak to Radcliff's staff.
===========ID 0x0002F6C8: I've gotten the run down from Deputy MacIntyre on both ambassadors. She's suggested I start by trying to negotiate with Ambassador Radcliff of the Freestar Collective - and dig up some dirt on her if she doesn't agree.
===========ID 0x0002F6C9: President Abello has directed me to speak to Deputy MacIntyre over in Interstellar Affairs. It sounds like she's going to help me get access to the Archives.
===========ID 0x0002F6DC: Members of the Shaw Gang tried to rob the GalBank in Akila City. Caught in the act, they took hostages and locked themselves inside. I was able to get inside the bank and take out the gang members, freeing the hostages.
===========ID 0x0002F6DD: Members of the Shaw Gang tried to rob the GalBank in Akila City. Caught in the act, they took hostages and locked themselves inside. I was able to persuade the bank robbers to release their hostages and surrender.
===========ID 0x0002F6DE: I need to get into GalBank so I can take out the bank robbers and free the hostages. I can ask to see the hostages and make sure they're safe, or sneak in through the back.
===========ID 0x0002F6DF: I was able to persuade the bank robbers to release their hostages and surrender. I need to let Marshal Blake know.
===========ID 0x0002F6E0: Some bank robbers are holed up in GalBank with hostages. I need to find out what the robbers want.
===========ID 0x0002F6E1: A guard in Akila City warned me about a hostage situation at GalBank. If I want to help, I need to talk to Marshal Blake, head of the Freestar Rangers. 
===========ID 0x0002F71C: My first mission as a Freestar Ranger Deputy is complete. Responding to a call for help, Ranger Emma Wilcox and I traveled to Montara Luna where we dealt with some thugs that were trying to take a farmer's land. The thugs turned out to be mercenaries with a ship stolen from the HopeTech factory. I still don't know who hired them or why.
===========ID 0x0002F71D: My first mission as a Freestar Ranger Deputy continues. Ranger Emma Wilcox and I tracked down and killed some thugs that were threatening a farmer. The thugs turned out to be mercenaries with a ship stolen from the HopeTech factory. I still don't know who hired them and why.
===========ID 0x0002F71E: My first mission as a Freestar Ranger Deputy continues. A farmer named Mikaela Waggoner is being threatened by some men who want her farm. Ranger Emma Wilcox and I defeated the thugs, and now it's time to look for clues to their identities and motivations.
===========ID 0x0002F71F: My first mission as a Freestar Ranger Deputy continues. A farmer named Mikaela Waggoner is being threatened by some men who want her farm. Ranger Emma Wilcox and I tracked down the thugs, who attacked us on sight.
===========ID 0x0002F720: My first mission as a Freestar Ranger Deputy continues. I traveled to Montara Luna and met a farmer named Mikaela Waggoner who's being threatened by some men that want to take her farm. Ranger Emma Wilcox and I have set out into the nearby canyons to find them.
===========ID 0x0002F721: I've officially joined the Freestar Rangers with the rank of Deputy, and I've been assigned to accompany Ranger Emma Wilcox as we investigate a plea for help from a farmer on Montara Luna who claims that someone is trying to steal her land.
===========ID 0x0002F722: I've joined the Freestar Rangers as a trainee and I've been assigned to undertake a field evaluation. I'll be joining a ranger named Helga Dubray as we respond to a call for help from a farmer on Montara Luna.
===========ID 0x0002F723: I've joined the Freestar Rangers as a trainee and now I'll be undertaking a field evaluation with another ranger.
===========ID 0x0002F724: To join up with the Freestar Rangers, Ranger Emma Wilcox tasked me with completing a mission to prove my worth. I did so, and now I've come back to the Rock. I reported to Emma, and she took me to speak to Marshal Blake.
===========ID 0x0002F725: As a way of proving my worthiness to join the Freestar Rangers, Ranger Emma Wilcox tasked me with completing a mission. Now that I've done so, I need to report back to Ranger Wilcox.
===========ID 0x0002F726: As a way of proving my worthiness to join the Freestar Rangers, Ranger Emma Wilcox tasked me with completing a mission from the mission terminal at the Rock in Akila City. She said I could choose any mission I wanted to, and I should report back to her when I complete it.
===========ID 0x0002F727: Marshal Daniel Blake directed me to speak to Ranger Emma Wilcox at the Rock in Akila City if I'm interested in joining the Freestar Rangers.
===========ID 0x0002F796: I've discovered that the GalBank Transport Legacy was lost near Bannoc IV, an EM-Class Gas Giant. This places two obstacles in my path to Kryx's Legacy: pinpointing the exact coordinates of the ship and discovering a way to penetrate an electromagnetic atmosphere.
===========ID 0x0002F797: I've gained all the information I can regarding the GalBank Transport "Legacy" and its location at Bannoc IV. I should now return to the Vigilance and report my findings to Commander Ikande.
===========ID 0x0002F798: I've gained all the information I can regarding the GalBank Transport "Legacy." I should now return to the Key and report my findings to Delgado.
===========ID 0x0002F799: After dealing with Ecliptic's ambush, I should now proceed to recover the information regarding the GalBank Transport "Legacy."
===========ID 0x0002F79B: Now that I've landed in New Atlantis, I should proceed to the GalBank Archives to locate any data on the GalBank Transport "Legacy."
===========ID 0x0002F79C: I've acquired Larry Dumbrosky's GalBank credentials. Time to wrap things up with Rokov, then head to New Atlantis and the GalBank Archives.
===========ID 0x0002F79D: I've recovered hard evidence of Larry Dumbrosky's part in the GalBank embezzlement scheme. It's time to approach him and gain the credentials I've been taking great pains to carefully acquire.
===========ID 0x0002F79E: After sabotaging the life support sensors, I've tripped the starliner's "lockdown mode." All of the passengers should be sequestered in their passenger cabins. I can now confront Gabriel Vera out of the public's view.
===========ID 0x0002F79F: Rokov suggested that I coax Gabriel Vera into his cabin by sabotaging the starliner's life support sensors. Then I should be able to confront him in private. I should proceed to that section of the ship.
===========ID 0x0002F7A0: Gabriel Vera is refusing to admit having any involvement with Swist and Dumbrosky's embezzlement scheme. I should meet up with Rokov and see if he has any ideas on how to get Vera to talk.
===========ID 0x0002F7A1: Klaudia Swist has disclosed her role in a scheme to embezzle cash from GalBank, implicating Larry Dumbrosky and someone named Gabriel Vera. I should speak to Vera and see if he can help obtain leverage on my target.
===========ID 0x0002F7A2: I've discovered that Larry Dumbrosky is having an affair with someone named Klaudia Swist. I should speak to her and see if she's willing to give me more information about Dumbrosky.
===========ID 0x0002F7A3: To learn more about the Legacy, I need the credentials of Larry Dumbrosky, a GalBank executive. I need to approach him cautiously, so I should gather information at the charity gala occurring aboard the Siren of the Stars.
===========ID 0x0002F7A4: I've arrived at the Siren of the Stars. I should dock with and board the starliner so I can speak to Evgeny Rokov.
===========ID 0x0002F7A5: To discover more about the Legacy, the GalBank transport with a fortune in credits, I need to proceed to the Siren of the Stars. This starliner is captained by Rokov, a former member of the Crimson Fleet.
===========ID 0x0002F7AF: I delivered Neshar's stash to Yannick Legrande. Yannick was pleased and wanted to rope me into more of his business.
===========ID 0x0002F7B0: The Felix situation is dealt with, so it's time to return to Yannick Legrande and give him the news.
===========ID 0x0002F7B1: Yannick is involved in Aurora smuggling in order to make Yannick's Blend. He's worried about his operation after Neshar's arrest and wants you to either convince Felix Sadler to leave Neon or kill him. Administrator Bayu would not look on any of this kindly if he finds out.
===========ID 0x0002F7B2: I have Neshar's package - now I just need to deliver it to Yannick Legrande.
===========ID 0x0002F7B3: Neshar Omani was smuggling chems while working with Yannick Legrande. He was supposed to deliver a package, and he's worried what will come of him if he doesn't deliver. He asked me to get the package from his Sleepcrate. He gave me his passcode so the Sleepcrate manager will let me in.
===========ID 0x0002F7B4: After landing on Neon, I encountered a man named Neshar Omani being apprehended by security for possessing Aurora. It might be worth talking to him in Neon Security.
===========ID 0x0002F7BD: Briggs was pleased at the Striker tags flying in Neon. Job done.
===========ID 0x0002F7BE: I hacked all the signs. Time to report back to Briggs at Madame Sauvage's.
===========ID 0x0002F7BF: The Ebbside Strikers need to advertise that they are back and put the Disciples on notice. I need to go to three locations and hack signs so they display the Strikers logo. Hatchet warned me I may encounter some Disciple resistance, plus some of the signs are on the roofs.
===========ID 0x0002F7C0: So I'm an Ebbside Striker now. Briggs said that Hatchet will give me my next gig.
===========ID 0x0002F7C4: I managed to navigate a minefield to secure some data for a friendly ship.
===========ID 0x0002F7C5: There is some data on a satellite nearby. Unfortunately, it's surrounded by mines. If a mine goes off - so does the data.
===========ID 0x0002F7CC: I scared off a group of tourists for Dr. Giuliana Lakota using a monster costume she lent me. Hopefully, fewer tourists means she can get back to treating her regular patients for a while. 
===========ID 0x0002F7CD: The plan worked, and the tourists are running scared! I should go tell Giuliana what happened.
===========ID 0x0002F7CE: I've got this ridiculous monster costume. Now it's time to scare off the tourists.
===========ID 0x0002F7CF: Dr. Lakota wants me to put on this monster costume she gave me and try to scare off a group of tourists in hopes word will spread and tourism will take a dive. She really dislikes tourists.
===========ID 0x0002F7D3: I helped Luthor at the New Homestead Chunks get some more Chunks special sauce.
===========ID 0x0002F7D4: I got the special sauce from the other Chunks. I need to bring that back to Luthor.
===========ID 0x0002F7D5: I agreed to help pick up a case of Chunks special sauce for Luthor, the manager of the New Homestead Chunks. I'll need to speak with someone at the other Chunks restaurant he's sending me to.
===========ID 0x0002F7E5: <Alias=PlanetLocation> is cleaned up. I should reach out to Commander Tuala if I want any more extermination work.
===========ID 0x0002F7E6: Commander Tuala's given me the location of my target. I'm to head to <Alias=PlanetLocation> and eliminate any Terrormorphs I encounter.
===========ID 0x0002F919: I helped Chief Jiro Sugiyama deal with a problematic guest at the Paradiso Resort Hotel.
===========ID 0x0002F91A: I've dealt with the belligerent hotel guest. I should report back to Chief Sugiyama and let him know he should no longer be a problem. 
===========ID 0x0002F91B: Security Chief Jiro Sugiyama wants me to help him out with a problem guest at the hotel. I'm going to go to his room and try to get him to leave.
===========ID 0x0002F924: Marko Jansen now has a job and real hope. He was profoundly grateful. Hopefully it'll set his family up for a much brighter future.
===========ID 0x0002F925: I cleared up Milena's problems with Mayor Elias. She's free and clear to return to Akila City. I should let Marko Jansen know the good news.
===========ID 0x0002F926: Tom Starrett is going to provide Milena with some forged credentials that'll get her safe passage back into Akila City. I should let Marko Jansen know the good news.
===========ID 0x0002F927: I met and saved Milena Axelrod - and she's happy to help the Jansens out. The only problem is she ran afoul of the law in Akila City. She asked me to clear her name either with Mayor Elias Cartwright or a Trade Authority fixer named Tom Starrett.
===========ID 0x0002F928: Marko Jansen moved to Akila City and has been just stuck. He's desperate and is hoping I can contact his wife's cousin, Milena Axelrod, to see if she can throw some work their way. Milena is a merchant and her ship is in the Akila System.
===========ID 0x0002F929: A guard mentioned the Jansen family has hit hard times since they've immigrated to Akila City. I might be able to help them out.
===========ID 0x0002F93E: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Infinity LTD will be left to shut down while Ryujin proceeds with Project Dominion under Ularu's watch as Ryujin's CEO.
===========ID 0x0002F93F: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Project Dominion will be shelved, Infinity LTD will be shut down, and Ryujin will continue under Ularu's leadership as CEO.
===========ID 0x0002F940: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Project Dominion will be shelved and Ryujin will be acquiring Infinity LTD as their latest subsidiary under Ularu as CEO.
===========ID 0x0002F941: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Ryujin will be acquiring Infinity LTD as their latest subsidiary and proceed with Project Dominion under Ularu's careful watch as CEO.
===========ID 0x0002F942: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Infinity LTD will be left to shut down while Ryujin proceeds with Project Dominion under Masako's careful watch.
===========ID 0x0002F943: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Project Dominion will be shelved and Infinity LTD will be shut down. 
===========ID 0x0002F944: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Project Dominion will be shelved and Ryujin will be acquiring Infinity LTD as their latest subsidiary under Masako's careful watch.
===========ID 0x0002F945: I exposed Infinity LTD's corruption and secured a new future for Ryujin Industries in a crucial board meeting. Ryujin will be acquiring Infinity LTD as their latest subsidiary and proceed with Project Dominion under Masako's careful watch.
===========ID 0x0002F946: It's time to lobby the board members. Masako wants Infinity LTD and Ularu wants Masako out. I'll need at least half of the votes on any issue to secure success. If I have strong feelings against the Internal Neuroamp, this would be my opportunity to get further research shut down.
===========ID 0x0002F947: It's time to lobby the board members. Masako will vote to acquire Infinity LTD and said I'll need at least half of the votes to secure success. If I have strong feelings against the Internal Neuroamp, this would be my opportunity to get further research shut down.
===========ID 0x0002F94D: With Kilman rescued, I've agreed to help Sloan and the Eleos Retreat on the next step - finding his kidnapper. She's directed me to explore an old science facility nearby.
===========ID 0x0002F94E: The construction foreman - Halftown - still seems pretty upset with the leaders of the Retreat. I should speak to Sloan to collect my reward... and see if there's anything else I can help with.
===========ID 0x0002F94F: Bringing back Kilman appears to have caused quite the stir. I should listen in to what's happening.
===========ID 0x0002F950: I found Kilman. He's alive, but it sounds like he was kidnapped. I need to get us both back to the Retreat ASAP. 
===========ID 0x0002F951: I've spoken to Greg. He lost Kilman's trail near a cave system outside the Retreat's territory. That seems like it'd be the best place to start looking.
===========ID 0x0002F952: I've agreed to help the Eleos Retreat find their missing construction worker - one Mr. Kilman. Retreat leader Sloan has suggested I speak to Greg D'Angelo, their security chief, who was wounded trying to find Kilman.
===========ID 0x0002F962: Another Gang Leader is out of commission.
===========ID 0x0002F963: Outlaws infest the systems in and near the Freestar Collective. It's the Rangers job to keep them in check. So it's my turn to take out an Outlaw Gang Leader.
===========ID 0x0002F96C: I rescued the <Alias=Prisoner> and the ship is now safe again. All in a days work for a Freestar Ranger.
===========ID 0x0002F96D: Taking ship captains hostage can be lucrative and deadly. The Rangers have been putting a priority on shutting down these crimes. There's a <Alias=Prisoner> who has been captured. I need to get to the <Alias=PrimaryRef> in the <Alias=TargetSystemLocation> system.
===========ID 0x0002F995: It wasn't easy - but the Ecliptic capital ship is no more.
===========ID 0x0002F996: I stumbled across a capital Ecliptic ship. It looks formidable. Attacking it with a ship that wasn't top-notch would be a bad idea. But I'm sure taking it out would be worth it.
===========ID 0x0002FA28: Tranquilitea's floral and fruity tea blend.
===========ID 0x0002FA2A: Tranquilitea's lotus flower tea.

===========ID 0x0002FFD4: Jake and the Enu: A Tale of Enlightenment

Part 2:
 
Jake cursed and pleaded with the thieves, but it was no use. Soon, every Enu was removed from the cave. Jake wept. What would become of the mountain? He continued visiting the cave each day. He cleaned the floors where the Enu had stood, and recited his good deeds to the walls. Jake dreaded the spring. Without the gift of the Enu's stream, what would become of his fields?
 
Then, in the spring, the stream flowed from the cave anyway.
 
Jake was confused, but his family wasted no time. They cultivated their fields, and that summer, they saw their most bountiful harvest in years.
 
The following spring, the stream appeared again. Jake began to wonder - were more Enu hiding in the cave? He waded into the stream, and traveled beyond the Enu's cavern - much further than he had before.
 
But instead of more Enu, Jake found a large, underground lake. 
 
He also found tunnels, bringing fresh water into the cave from the rainy side of the mountain.
 
Later that day, Jake traveled down to the village in the valley. He found its people desperate, and their lands parched. Jake visited the farms of the village. He found an Enu statue placed in each one, but he could see that the rocky, dry land would never grow fruit.
 
That evening, Jake returned to his wife, and shared what he had seen. They spent all night looking down on the valley. In the morning, they called for their sons, and the family harvested their fields. They packed half of all they had grown in large, wooden carts.

The next day, Jake stood at the mouth of the Enu's cave. He turned, and joined his family as they traveled down the mountain.

===========ID 0x0002FFDC: When the Ancient World was young, the civilization of Egypt was already old. The Pyramids of Giza still tower over Cairo and awed Roman Legionnaires and Napoleon's soldiers as much as any modern visitor. But it was more than a tourist destination, the fertile Nile was a key bread basket and valuable source of revenue for thousands of years. It's influence on the Mediterranean was and is profound.

Using the latest technology, we have new insights and glimpses into the rise of Ancient Egypt and how its society changed over the many years. So come with us on a trip through the land of Pharaohs and Pyramids.

[So starts a definitive work of the History of Egypt by a collection of unknown archaeologists and anthropologists published in 2133.]

Part I:

Atheism was just the first step, for me.

I was raised in a world of right and wrong. I walked among chosen people. Each night, my family would gather and pray for the sinners in our lives to find salvation.

I can't tell you exactly when I stopped believing in these things. Like many who lose their faith, for me the cracks formed slowly over time: an illogical verse here, an unanswered question there. One day, you realize you're working hard to hold onto something false. You don't want to lose your community, or your connection to your family. But sometimes, maybe things that don't make sense are just wrong.

The details of my awakening aren't important, but what came next is. I never expected that losing my faith would begin a profound new chapter in my life: a time of deep compassion and charity, as a member of the Enlightened.
===========ID 0x000304D8: Update: apparently someone else got there first - nothing was at the location.
===========ID 0x000304DA: [When it became widely accepted that the Earth would have to be evacuated, a group of prominent architects teamed together to produce this book. It contains a bonanza of high definition pictures, detailed floor plans, and behind-the-scenes information about the architectural wonders of some of the great cities of Earth. New York, London, Washington DC, Paris, and Tokyo are the central focus.

In this reprinting, one of the primary architects of New Atlantis acknowledges how inspirational she found these pages and how it influenced the design of the city she was building. This book is considered to be one of the most important tomes of architectural history.]

===========ID 0x000304E2: Update: apparently someone else got there first - nothing was at the location.
===========ID 0x000304E4: Up until the wide availability of steel, buildings rarely were over seven stories. The amount of structural support brick buildings needed made going over ten stories effectively impossible. In the early 20th centuries the availability of industrial strength steel and advances in engineering design led to the dawn of the skyscraper. And then the race to the heavens was on. 

Eighty years after the first skyscrapers were built, techniques advanced so that a building in Dubai was fully double the height of those early goliaths. And the race to go higher, faster was only beginning. Here are the stories and history of some of Earth's most impressive structures.

[Thus begins the architectural novel Race to the Heavens covering the stories of many of the greatest buildings of Earth.] 

===========ID 0x000304E6: And I sit. Like my grandfather and great-grandfather before me I know I will never leave this prison. My wife said my family was cursed. The Nagatas thought perhaps whatever spirits we offended would leave us be when we fled Osaka. But... maybe we are cursed.

And all of this because I lifted baby formula. These "laws" are pitiless, leaving my wife... my child... with no hope. And I just sit here... getting angrier. They think they can just lock us away on some forgotten planet. But instead they feed this prison more bodies, more rage, more vengeance. One day, the Warden will pay. Maybe not this Warden, but they will regret their justice. And our vengeance will be the stuff of Legends.

Part II:

My settlement was founded as a commune by the members of my family's church: a place where the congregation could worship in peace, without interference. 

But word travels fast, and our small colony began to grow. Our success attracted those in need of help, and those with nowhere else to turn.

When I was 10 years old, I watched two officers lead a frail-looking man down our street. He had been stealing from our settlement's emergency rations. Our local security had been trying to catch the thief for weeks.

I asked my parents if the man was hungry. If he didn't have enough to eat, couldn't we feed him the same food he had been stealing?

My parents explained that while our settlement probably could afford to feed the man, stealing is a sin, and the thief must ask God for forgiveness. That night, my family gathered to pray for the soul of the man. They asked God to help him see beyond a life of sin. 

That man's name was Edgar, and he didn't need our prayers. Edgar needed food, and work. Since no one gave him either, Edgar would be in and out of our settlement's prison for several years to come.

Part III:

When I was 19 years old, my church decided it was time to leave.

The announcement was filled with phrases like "fresh start" and "renewal". Apparently, our settlement had taken in too many non-believers. The congregation would pack up, and build a new colony on a distant world: a place without outsiders, where their faith could become the law.

"Cowards! You're running away!" I begged my family not to leave. "These people came here for our help. If we take their generators, how will the rest of the colony survive?"

To most of my community, these arguments made no difference. They could only see the outsiders as outsiders: non-believers, who were preventing them from living a pure life.

"These people have been coming here since you were a little girl." My father told me, one night, "They've had nearly twenty years to hear the word of god, but that's not what they want. We will leave them to their lives, and they should leave us to ours."

Word traveled quickly through the poor parts of the settlement. As the departure date neared, the other colonists became desperate. Protests were common outside of the church buildings, and outside of our Starport, where a large, arc-like ship was being constructed.

Finally, on departure day, dozens of colonists gathered at the entrance to the Starport. They blocked the church from entering - a hundred gaunt faces, against a hundred blue robes.

But the group was no match for the church's security forces. That team cleared a path, and the congregation boarded their arc. The crowd could only watch as the ship roared to life, and then vanished into the sky.

I stood in that crowd, watching as well. I could not bring myself to leave. Any faith which abandons the helpless was a faith I could not believe in. A loving god who inspired such cruelty must not be real. I would stay behind, for whatever came next.

Part IV:

Of the five generators that once powered our settlement, my family's church had left behind just one. But with no one left with the knowledge to repair it, blackouts were frequent.

Nine months after the church members left, conditions in our settlement were dire. Most of the colony's credits had left with the congregation, and merchants no longer had a reason to visit. We began rationing our remaining food, but supplies were running low. Anyone with a means to escape had long since left the planet.

We faced a total collapse, if not for what happened next.

The first ship arrived at night, and woke up the whole settlement. No one had visited in months. In the dark, dozens of us made our way to the Starport and found new craft landed there - large, but older. On its side was painted an golden symbol: six hands, joined around a planet.

"Hello!" Yelled a man from the boarding ramp, "I'm Dr. Dewan. My friends and I are from the Enlightened. We heard there may be a settlement out here, in trouble."

I pushed to the front of the crowd. "Our generator's failed. We have about a week of recycled water left. Do you have anyone who can fix it?"

"OK!" he said, "We can hook up your recycler to pull power from our ship. Then we can see about those repairs."

"Hey!" someone yelled from the crowd, "Are you people from some kind of church?"

The man stopped and laughed. "No!" He shouted back, "We're actually kind of the opposite!"

Over the next few days, more Enlightened ships arrived. Their crews fed us, and restored our settlement's power, but then they didn't leave. Through Dr. Dewan, we learned more about the Enlightened: they called themselves "atheist humanists". He told us they go to places in the galaxy where people need help. "Without gods," he said, "all we have is each other."

The Enlightened took up residence on the grounds of the old church, and began teaching us survival skills: how to cook, and how repair our colony's equipment. They lent us credits to buy supplies, and within half a year, our settlement was functioning independently.

Eventually, the Enlightened packed up, and left our colony to survive on its own. But this time, I left too, as the newest member of their group.

I had finally found a cause that made sense to me - an ethos I could believe in, without ignoring part of myself: There are no gods to worship. No divine beings are coming to save us. Humanity's capacity for empathy - and our willingness to support each other - is our species' best hope to survive among the stars. It's up to mankind to watch over itself.

Apparently, you can still find the remnants of one of the old Apollo missions. Something of a secret rite of passage for chairs of Constellation, if Banks was to be believed.

During one of those rare interludes of calm, while doing other research on Earth, I figured I could spare the time. I was, as they say, in the neighborhood. It took some serious scanning and a couple false leads... but I found it. To walk in the same place as those earliest of interstellar explorers... Unbelievable what they achieved with such primitive technology. I found the whole experience moving. Inspiring. I will advise my successor to do the same. We'll make a proper tradition of it yet.

===========ID 0x00030BC6: We've returned to base. Time to discuss what we've uncovered.
===========ID 0x00030BC7: Vae Victis knew about the Lazarus Plant and likely blew the spaceport to pieces trying to cover it up. But we've got work still to do. Time to collect that final sample and get out of here.
===========ID 0x00030BC8: I've got the recorder log documenting that Vae Victis was here and knew about the Lazarus Plant. I should discuss what I've learned with Hadrian.
===========ID 0x00030BC9: The recording we just heard... it sounded a lot like Vae Victis knew about the Lazarus Plant. I should grab the transcription and speak to Hadrian about what we learned.
===========ID 0x00030BCA: It sounds like Vae Victis was here just before he ordered the bombing of the spaceport. I should listen in.
===========ID 0x00030BCB: Sample secure. Time to blow this icicle stand and debrief with Percival back at the base.
===========ID 0x00030BCC: All right. Sample acquired. Just need to store it in Kaiser.
===========ID 0x00030BCD: We've taken down the Terrormorph containing our final sample. Time to collect it and get out of here.
===========ID 0x00030BCE: It sounds like Percival's got a way for me to nullify the anomaly's connection to its thralls! Powering up the radar dishes around the spaceport should do the trick!

===========ID 0x00030BD2: The door out to the spaceport - and the final sample - has lost power. There should be a power control board in the Security Office upstairs.
===========ID 0x00030BD3: Our conclusion is the Terrormorph attacks may well have been triggered. But by who? And why? Regardless, our current task is still worth finishing. Time to find that final sample.
===========ID 0x00030BD4: The sample we just found is a match for the ones from New Atlantis and Tau Ceti. This means someone most likely coordinated those attacks. I need to discuss this with Hadrian.
===========ID 0x00030BD5: I need to hand over the sample to Kaiser and we can get to the bottom of the transformation we witnessed.
===========ID 0x00030BD6: We took care of the Terrormorph. I just need to collect a tissue sample.
===========ID 0x00030BD7: We need to track and kill the Terrormorph... or Heatleech... and kill it and figure out if this might have something to do with the attacks!
===========ID 0x00030BD8: We just watched a Heatleech... become a Terrormorph. I should talk to Hadrian about what this might mean!
===========ID 0x00030BD9: Hadrian's spotted a Lazarus Plant in bloom - a real rarity, she says. I should go take a look. 
===========ID 0x00030BDA: Looks like the path to our next sample leads through the Londinion steam tunnels.
===========ID 0x00030BDB: I've handed over the Aceles samples to Kaiser. Now we just need to figure out where we're heading next.
===========ID 0x00030BDC: All samples collected! Now I just need to hand them off to Kaiser.
===========ID 0x00030BDD: All samples collected! Now I just need to take care of these hostiles!
===========ID 0x00030BDE: Hadrian's directed me to hand over the sample to Kaiser for safe keeping.
===========ID 0x00030BDF: Kaiser's found something and Hadrian says its got the info we're looking for. I should speak to her to see for myself.
===========ID 0x00030BE0: Kaiser's going to try and find us location of this first sample using the shipping yard's computers. I should follow him. 
===========ID 0x00030BE1: Kaiser's pinpointed the location of the Aceles cells in the shipping yard. Just need to find them, collect them, and not get eaten in the process.
===========ID 0x00030BE2: The processing plant's been cleared and it appears there's a field cache in here. We should check it out to recharge.
===========ID 0x00030BE3: Our path through the plant's blocked! We need to deal with these creatures!
===========ID 0x00030BE4: Percival's found us our first materials in a nearby shipping yard. We're heading there now.
===========ID 0x00030BE6: All gear collected. Time to check in with Hadrian.
===========ID 0x00030BE7: Briefings complete. I can either head to the armory to collect my gear or speak to Hadrian about moving out.
===========ID 0x00030BE8: Commander Hatoum's finished her briefing. We're going to be on our own out there. Hadrian has a couple remaining things she wants to discuss. 
===========ID 0x00030BE9: The plan is to remove the Terrormorphs from human worlds - by either bringing back their natural predator or releasing a microbe to deal with them. But first, we'll need some raw materials. And the only place to collect those? Londinion. I'm to speak to Commander Hatoum on the only base on the planet.
===========ID 0x00030BEA: Hadrian says she has a plan for dealing with the Terrormorphs. I should follow her to find out more.
===========ID 0x00030CA9: I successfully wiped all evidence of Project Dominion from Infinity LTD and handed over evidence of their crimes to David Barron at SSNN.
===========ID 0x00030CAA: I successfully tested the Internal Neuroamp. I should head back down and see what they have to say.
===========ID 0x00030CBA: <Alias=QuestGiver> rewarded me for gathering the minerals for <Alias.Pronoun=QuestGiver> to scan.
===========ID 0x00030CBB: The <Alias.Name=QuestGiver> is dead.
===========ID 0x00030CBC: I gathered the mineral samples for the <Alias=QuestGiver>. Now I just need to return to <Alias=OverlayMapMarker> and get them scanned.
===========ID 0x00030CBD: A member of a group of <Alias.PluralName=QuestGiver> on <Alias=Planet> wants me to go gather mineral samples in a nearby cave. I get to keep the minerals, <Alias.Pronoun=QuestGiver> just needs to scan them.
===========ID 0x00030D63: Ron Hope's family came from Los Angeles on Earth. It was a major city way back then. I wonder if anything is left of it?
===========ID 0x00030D66: A book on architecture mentioned a goliath of a building in an old Earth city called Dubai. Maybe it's still there.
===========ID 0x00030E02: Survey revealed nothing of interest.

===========ID 0x00030E0E: When the ink dried - Napoleon indeed got the funds he desperately needed, but a dark chapter of American history started. The Louisiana Purchase would open most of the North American continent to rampant unchecked expansion as brutal as anything that took place in the Colonial Era. 

What would in time be called "Manifest Destiny," was for centuries looked as a positive movement. It was spreading the virtues of democracy and capitalism to vast new territories. But for all too many indigenous Americans it was at best forced relocation and all too often a death sentence. But this willful blindness to the cost of Manifest Destiny would take over a century to be fully acknowledged. One might argues it still is glossed over to this day in too many circles. St. Louis, dubbed the Gateway to the West, so venerated the concept they built a monument to it in the mid-20th century.

===========ID 0x00030E22: Scanning Earth was astonishing. There's just nothing. The whole planet is covered with sand and will never support life again. I did scan after scan of the major population centers and returned nothing. I did get a glimmer on the ancient site of Hong Kong. It was faint, I wasn't sure I just imagined it. But... I landed there.

And there amidst the unrecognizable sands was something. What was this edifice? This monument of a now-dead civilization? It was humbling... and deeply depressing.

[Excerpts from Maurice Lyon's journal.]
===========ID 0x00030E24: Jake and the Enu: A Tale of Enlightenment

Part 1:
 
Since he was a boy, Jake's family had protected the Enu, the ancient creatures who brought life to his mountain. Each day, Jake would enter their cave and clean the stone statues that connected the Enu to this world. He kept their location secret, and shielded the Enu from the greedy men who lived in the valley of the mountain. Jake was always kind to his wife and sons, so that he could tell the Enu of his good deeds.
 
The Enu rewarded Jake's devotion by bringing his family the life-giving stream. Each spring, it would flow from the mouth of their cave, and bless his fields with a bountiful harvest. This blessing had only grown stronger each year. Jake's farmland was so prosperous that it covered the mountain, and was seen by those in the valley.
 
One day, two men visited Jake's farm.
 
"Let us buy your grains, and your fruits," They said, "for none will grow, beyond the mountain." But Jake turned them away. 

"The valley has run dry, and surely you could make do with less." But the men's coins were of no use to Jake, for he received all that he needed from the Enu.
 
One night, Jake woke to sounds coming from the Enu's cave. He raced to the entrance, only to find the cave filled with men from the valley. Each one held a Enu statue, and was carrying it down from the mountain.

Jake cried for them to stop, but one man held him at the mouth of the cave. "The lands of the valley are dying." he said, "These spirits can bring us water, but you have kept them all to yourself. We will leave what you have already grown, but we are taking the Enu to the valley."

===========ID 0x00030FB3: I've managed to commandeer the prototype ship with the ComSpike module. I grav jumped back to the Key and after speaking to Huan, can now deliver the good news to Delgado.
===========ID 0x00030FB4: I've managed to commandeer the prototype ship with the ComSpike module. I grav jumped back to the Key and can now talk to the parties involved about the status of the mission.
===========ID 0x00030FB5: I've managed to commandeer the prototype ship with the ComSpike module. I need to grav jump back to the Key and deliver it to Delgado.
===========ID 0x00030FB6: I've learned the ComSpike is a ship module, and the prototype ship it's attached to is docked at Docking Bay 8. I'll need to commandeer the ship and bring it back to the Key.
===========ID 0x00030FB7: I've learned the ComSpike is being held at Docking Bay 8. I'll need to find a way past the checkpoint in order to access the ship.
===========ID 0x00030FB8: I've learned the ComSpike is being held at Docking Bay 8. I'll need to find a way past the checkpoint in order to access the ship.
===========ID 0x00030FB9: I've reached the Engineering Bay, where the ComSpike is being developed by Dr. Gabriel Vogel. While exploring, I found a key which should give me access to the docking bays.
===========ID 0x00030FBA: I've reached the Engineering Bay, where the ComSpike is being developed by Dr. Gabriel Vogel. I can speak to Dr. Vogel or search for a terminal that might offer information on its exact location.
===========ID 0x00030FBB: According to the archive terminals, the ComSpike is being developed in the Engineering Bay. I need to use the terminals to gain access to the elevators.
===========ID 0x00030FBC: According to the archive terminals, the ComSpike is being developed in the Engineering Bay.
===========ID 0x00030FBD: I've entered the Command Bay. I'll need to find information on the project in order to locate the ComSpike.
===========ID 0x00030FBE: In order to find the ComSpike on SY-920, I need to first get access to the Command Bay. Finding a uniform in the barracks area might help me bypass checkpoints and move around undetected.
===========ID 0x00030FBF: After docking at SY-920, I boarded the station and found myself in a cargo hold. In order to find the ComSpike, I need to first get access to the Command Bay.
===========ID 0x00030FC0: After docking at SY-920, I boarded the station and found myself in a cargo hold. I spoke with Huan via an intercom and she suggested I find a way to the barracks, where I can pick up a uniform to better blend in.
===========ID 0x00030FC1: Traveling with Huan on the Jade Swan, we arrived at SY-920, a secure UC military starstation. I should speak with her before boarding.
===========ID 0x00030FC2: After taking flight during an explosion, the Jade Swan has returned to the spaceport. I should meet Huan and continue traveling to SY-920.
===========ID 0x00030FC3: After taking flight during an explosion, the Jade Swan has returned to the spaceport. I should meet Huan and continue traveling to SY-920.
===========ID 0x00030FC4: I've joined the crew of the Jade Swan, a cargo ship that delivers goods to SY-920. Once we arrive, I'll need to infiltrate the station and find the ComSpike.
===========ID 0x00030FC5: I spoke to the smuggler Huan Daiyu about boarding SY-920. She's asked me to meet her on her ship to go over the details of the operation.
===========ID 0x00030FC6: I spoke to the smuggler Huan Daiyu about boarding SY-920. She's asked me to meet her on her ship to go over the details of the operation.
===========ID 0x00030FC7: According to Naeva, the ComSpike is being held at a top secret UC Starstation, SY-920. To board it, I'll need to speak with one of her smuggling contacts, Huan Daiyu.
===========ID 0x00030FC8: According to Naeva, the ComSpike is being held at a top secret UC Starstation, SY-920. To board it, I'll need to speak with one of her smuggling contacts, Huan Daiyu.
===========ID 0x00030FC9: Delgado has asked that I talk to Naeva and Jasmine and work out a plan to get the ComSpike.
===========ID 0x00030FCA: Delgado has asked that I talk to Naeva and Jasmine and work out a plan to get the ComSpike.
===========ID 0x00030FCB: I've betrayed Huan to Dr. Vogel in hopes of diverting attention away and securing the prototype ship for myself.
===========ID 0x00030FCF: I need to report back to Abe and let him know how the relative reacted to the news about having a long lost relative.
===========ID 0x00030FD0: Abe Levitz has asked me to find one of his crewmember's relatives and deliver a message letting them know they'd like to meet with them.
===========ID 0x00030FEE: I killed Alban Lopez for Jacquelyn Lemaire, and the system is now free of Spacers. But it seems like Chanda Banda knows Jackie killed Alban. It may be best to avoid the <Alias=SystemLocation> system in the future.
===========ID 0x00030FEF: The families and I removed the last of the Spacers from the <Alias=SystemLocation> system. Alban Lopez was emotional and deeply thankful.
===========ID 0x00030FF0: The Spacers have been dealt with. Time to report back to get paid.
===========ID 0x00030FF1: Jacquelyn Lemaire has asked me to quietly assassinate Alban Lopez. She says he can't be trusted. If I want to do this for her, I need to take care of it before the Spacers are all eliminated.
===========ID 0x00030FF2: Alban Lopez found that the Spacers are using a Derelict Starstation as their base. The plan is to eliminate their ships then board the Starstation and put an end to them for good.
===========ID 0x00030FF3: The LIST families now have a Defense Pact. Alban Lopez has asked me to take out two Spacer ship contact groups, and then report back to him at his farm.
===========ID 0x00030FF4: Alban Lopez wants to have all the LIST families join a Defensive Pact to take care of the immediate Spacer problem (and beyond). I need to convince Chanda Banda to join. Getting Jacquelyn Lemaire to join would be even better.
===========ID 0x00030FF5: I fixed the four families' communication satellites. The leaders of the three surviving families are meeting on Jacquelyn Lemaire's ship. Alban Lopez wants me to go there to pick up my pay.
===========ID 0x00030FF6: I fixed the Lopez family's satellite. Now I have to fix the rest of the families satellites in the system: the Bandas, Lemaires, and Wens. The Spacers will probably have ships there to stop me.
===========ID 0x00030FF7: Alban Lopez has a communication satellite that needs to be fixed. There are probably Spacers there. Once I fix it, Alban will contact me with more information.
===========ID 0x00030FF8: Someone named Alban Lopez is sending a distress call asking for help from LIST. I could drop by and investigate.
===========ID 0x00031015: I need to get past a guard to get into the secure wing. Ari Miller mentioned the guard is recovering from an Aurora addiction and has a bit of a crush on Dr. Osian. Perhaps I can use this information to my advantage.
===========ID 0x00031018: I need to run the Overseer program on Faye's computer on the Research and Development floor.

===========ID 0x00031139: We spoke to Helgi and attempted to convince him to serve as a witness in the upcoming trial. We should return to Ellie's office and deliver the news.
===========ID 0x0003113A: Despite obtaining the evidence to clear Ervin's name, Ellie believes we still need to find a witness to testify. She believes Dr. Helgi Hauksson is still in Gagarin and may be willing to cooperate. After interviewing some locals we were able to determine his location.
===========ID 0x0003113B: Despite obtaining the evidence to clear Ervin's name, Ellie believes we still need to find a witness to testify. She believes Dr. Helgi Hauksson is still in Gagarin and may be willing to cooperate.
===========ID 0x0003113C: After investigating Mine H-363 we discovered that Ervin was not responsible for the ecological disaster that befell the mine. We should return to Ellie Yankton in Gagarin and deliver the good news.
===========ID 0x0003113D: We downloaded the coordinates to the mine Ervin worked at, H-363. We arrived at the location and should look for any evidence that would exonerate him.
===========ID 0x0003113E: We downloaded the coordinates to the mine Ervin worked at, H-363. We should visit the location and see if we can't find any evidence that would exonerate him.
===========ID 0x0003113F: In order to exonerate Ervin Madani and restore his reputation, we first need to gather information. Ellie Yankton has suggested we locate the mine he was assigned to and comb it for evidence.
===========ID 0x00031140: We've uncovered evidence that may exonerate Ervin. It may be worth discussing it with Ellie Yankton to see if we have enough to go to trial.
===========ID 0x00031141: After investigating Ervin's apartment we found an application for hunting license. We may be able to find a copy of this license if we search the records at Town Hall.

===========ID 0x00031174: I've downloaded the Conduction Grid data, but unfortunately, it's heavily encrypted. In order to make use of the data, I'll need to acquire an Encryption Cipher from Breyson Bayu, Generdyne's Chief Technician.
===========ID 0x00031175: I've entered Generdyne's Power Core. I should be able to download the Conduction Grid's tech from the facility's computer access point.

===========ID 0x00031617: I should speak to <Alias=QuestGiver> to find out what my next assignment is.

===========ID 0x0003161E: Due to vital information I recovered, Ryujin Industries has learned that Infinity LTD stole confidential technology called Project Dominion. Masako believes this means there's a mole within the corporation.
===========ID 0x0003163E: I helped the Paradiso Group by destroying the ECS Constant from the inside by overloading their reactor. The skies are clear around Paradiso once again. Well, except for the space debris.
===========ID 0x0003163F: Now that the ECS Constant has been destroyed, I should inform Oliver Campbell that it is no longer a problem.
===========ID 0x00031640: The ECS Constant is set to blow up! I need to make my escape back to my ship quickly!
===========ID 0x00031641: I've set the ECS Constant's reactor to overload, but it requires confirmation from the Captain's computer on the bridge. I might want to access it when she's not around.
===========ID 0x00031642: I helped the colonists of the ECS Constant by outfitting their ship with a Grav Drive. They are now free to find a new homeworld, but I get the impression that Captain Brackenridge will never be satisfied with anything less than Porrima II.
===========ID 0x00031643: The Grav Drive is all set to be installed, which should allow the ECS Constant to travel and find a new home. I should speak with Captain Brackenridge to make sure she doesn't need anything else.
===========ID 0x00031644: Amin has asked me to handle three preparations: reroute power from the port turbopump to the auxiliary cryogenic radiator, turn the plasma run-off inhibitor to 5%, and decouple the magnetic flange pipe enclosures from the auxiliary module assembly.
===========ID 0x00031645: Now that we have a compatible grav drive for the ECS Constant, I need to speak with their Engineering Officer, Amin Kazemi to figure out what we need to do to prepare the ship for its installation.
===========ID 0x00031646: I've decided to help the ECS Constant by purchasing a grav drive for their ship. Oliver Campbell referred me to Bennu St. James at HopeTech, who has some experience with working on specialized ship modifications.
===========ID 0x00031647: I helped the colonists of ECS Constant by negotiating an agreement with Oliver Campbell to allow them to settle within Paradiso under the condition they would owe the Paradiso Group a debt that must be repaid by working for the resort.
===========ID 0x00031648: I brought the colonists down to Paradiso. I should speak with Captain Brackenridge to make sure she doesn't need anything else.
===========ID 0x00031649: Now that we have the resources Oliver Campbell asked for, it's time to ferry Captain Brackenridge and some of her crew down to Paradiso.
===========ID 0x0003164A: I have enough resources now. I should return to Captain Brackenridge and let her know we're ready to send people down to Paradiso.
===========ID 0x0003164B: I need to gather the resources Oliver asked me for before I can help the colonists settle. Captain Brackenridge told me I can get some of the ECS Constant's resources from Daisuke on board the ship.
===========ID 0x0003164C: Before I can help the ECS Constant colonists settle in Paradiso, Oliver wanted me to gather resources to help improve their facilities so they can better accommodate the new arrivals.
===========ID 0x0003164D: I need to go speak with Captain Brackenridge regarding the deal I worked out with Paradiso.
===========ID 0x0003164E: Jiro pointed me to Paradiso Group CEO, Oliver Campbell. Since he and the other board directors have the authority to make decisions, I should speak with him regarding the ECS Constant.
===========ID 0x0003164F: After discussing the ECS Constant situation with Captain Brackenridge, I should venture down to Paradiso and speak with their Chief Security Officer, Jiro Sugiyama, who contacted my ship when I entered orbit.
===========ID 0x00031650: Captain Brackenridge is waiting to discuss her ship's situation with me.
===========ID 0x00031651: Captain Brackenridge has briefly explained the situation and welcomed me on board. I should follow her to the bridge to discuss the matter in more detail.
===========ID 0x00031652: There are people on board. I should speak with the ship's captain.
===========ID 0x00031653: Communications with the ship have failed. Even though it could be dangerous, I should see if I can complete a docking procedure with it and go on board.
===========ID 0x00031654: There's an ominous ship in orbit above Paradiso. I should attempt to communicate with it.
===========ID 0x00031655: I received a message from Paradiso Chief Security Officer, Jiro Sugiyama. There's a sensitive matter he wishes to discuss. I should meet him in Paradiso.
===========ID 0x00031686: I was able to sway a rival executive to ensure a deal for Ryujin Industries would go through.
===========ID 0x00031687: I eliminated an executive that refused to make a deal with Ryujin Industries.
===========ID 0x00031688: The executive wouldn't take my advice, so I killed them. I need to return to <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> at Ryujin Tower on the Executive floor and let her know how it went.
===========ID 0x00031689: I ensured the executive would agree to the deal with Ryujin Industries. I need to return to <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> at Ryujin Tower on the Executive floor and let her know how it went.
===========ID 0x0003168A: Although <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> told me not to, I killed the executive. I need to return to her at Ryujin Tower on the Executive floor and let her know how it went.
===========ID 0x0003168B: I need to find the executive at <Alias=ChosenLocation> and persuade them to side with Ryujin Industries.
===========ID 0x0003168C: <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> wants me to sway an executive on a deal. I can find them at <Alias=ChosenLocation> orbiting <Alias=ChosenLocation_Planet> in the <Alias=ChosenLocation_System> System.
===========ID 0x0003168D: <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> wants me to sway an executive on a deal. I can find them at <Alias=ChosenLocation> on <Alias=ChosenLocation_Planet> in the <Alias=ChosenLocation_System> System.
===========ID 0x0003168E: I received a notification that <Alias.ShortName=QuestGiver> has an assignment for me. I should head to her office on the Executive floor and talk to her about the details.
===========ID 0x00031759: I got the Artifact from Captain Petrov, but something is wrong in the Lodge. I should see what's happening.
===========ID 0x0003175A: I should return to the Lodge and add the Artifact to the collection.
===========ID 0x0003175B: I have the Artifact. Time to leave the Scow.
===========ID 0x0003175C: Captain Petrov has opened fire. If I want the Artifact, I either need to break into the vault or fight the Captain until he surrenders the key.
===========ID 0x0003175D: I've talked Petrov into letting me see the vault. I should follow him.
===========ID 0x0003175E: I need to find a way into Petrov's vault, where he's keeping the Artifact. If I can't persuade him to let me in, I might have to break in, or fight Petrov until he surrenders.
===========ID 0x0003175F: I've made it aboard the Scow. Time to find Captain Petrov.
===========ID 0x00031760: The Scow has opened fire. I'll need to board it by force.
===========ID 0x00031761: The Scow is letting me board peacefully. Time to head in and find Captain Petrov.
===========ID 0x00031762: I'm in orbit near the Scow. I can either try to talk my way on board, or open fire, disable the engines, and board by force.
===========ID 0x00031763: I need to retrieve an Artifact from Captain Petrov, who owns a salvage ship called the Scow. Vladimir suggested I might have to steal the Artifact.
===========ID 0x00031764: Vladimir Sall needs my help with something. I'll have to speak to him to find out what.
===========ID 0x00031780: The Artifact has been added to the collection. Sam and Cora Coe have offered to travel with me again in the future.
===========ID 0x00031781: We have the Artifact. Time to get back to the Lodge.
===========ID 0x00031782: Solomon's maps are pointing us to a cave inside of Shaw Gang territory, on the frontier of Akila.
===========ID 0x00031783: We have Solomon's Maps. I should talk to Sam.
===========ID 0x00031784: We need to get Solomon's Maps from Jacob Coe. I could try talking to him, or I could set up a distraction with Sam, or maybe we can ask Cora for help.
===========ID 0x00031785: Solomon's maps weren't in GalBank. Someone named Jacob got to them first, and he's waiting for Sam to come talk to him at the Coe Estate.
===========ID 0x00031786: The robbery at GalBank has been dealt with. Sam and I should be able to get Solomon's maps now.
===========ID 0x00031787: There's trouble at GalBank. Sam and I won't be able to get Solomon's maps until after the robbers are dealt with.
===========ID 0x00031788: Sam Coe will be coming with me until we find the Artifact on Akila. First stop is GalBank to find his ancestor Solomon's maps.

I won't miss my life. It was filled with violence from the start, but at least it didn't end that way. That's thanks to a certain Freestar Ranger Deputy who let me die quietly and in peace, the way I wanted.

Deputy, if this slate should come your way, please know you have my eternal gratitude. When your days are done, I'll buy you a drink in that big saloon in the sky.

There's got to be one, right? Guess I'll know soon enough.

===========ID 0x00031BF2: So you're on the lookout for a habitable planet? Well, aren't we all!

The League of Independent Settlers defines a habitable planet as any one that:

  1.) Has a breathable atmosphere.
  2.) Has a safe temperature. 

And that's it. Yes, it's really that simple! 

Here's a tip. When in doubt, go where the life is! If flora and fauna can exist on a planet, there's a good chance we humans can too.

LIST thanks you for all of your hard work. Now go forth and settle the stars!
===========ID 0x00031BF6: So the other day I went on a rescue mission. 

An asteroid was slated to hit a moon in one of the outer systems, and I wanted to get some genetic samples before they went extinct.

Well, I managed to get one. This suspiciously cactus-looking thing here. I didn't know what it was, only that it was beautiful. 

It's not until I scanned it back home that I realized, it wasn't native to the system. The flora was alien!

Somehow a seed had stowed away on someone's ship, and managed to plant itself on this unremarkable moon, like a rogue dandelion clock dancing through space.

And I thought, well, isn't that a kindred spirit! This whimsical little cactus is an explorer, just like us. 

To me, what we do at Constellation is always bittersweet. When we explore new worlds, we leave our homes behind. In a way, that's what this plant represents. It's a hello, and a goodbye. 

So I'm giving this plant to you Barrett, in hopes that you never lose your sense of adventure, and the places you call home. 

Let it be a celebration of every long goodbye, and each new beginning.

===========ID 0x00031DBF: On July 25, 1976, the Viking 1 orbiter spacecraft took its first photos of the Cydonia region of Mars. Among them was an image of what appeared to be a humanoid face on the surface of Mars. The image inspired the imaginations of millions, cementing humanity's passion for space exploration and once again begging the question "Are we alone out there?" 

Later photography would reveal that the face was no more than a mountain, shadows, and perhaps humanity's greatest case of "pareidolia," a tendency to perceive specific, meaningful imagery in an otherwise ambiguous or random visual pattern. Nevertheless, the legend of the "Face on Mars" remains an important inspiration for many to this day.

===========ID 0x00032A96: STATUS EFFECTS
Afflictions are listed in your "Status Effects." There are two types of Afflictions. Injuries are gained from risky activities, like falling from a great height. Infections are gained from damage taken by creatures and biological hazards.

SEVERITY
Basic Afflictions have a single symptom. "Acute" and "Severe" Afflictions have additional symptoms. If you would gain an Affliction but already have it, its severity worsens instead. 

For example, a Fractured Limb Affliction would have only one symptom, such as Intense Pain (which increases damage done to you). A Fractured Limb (Severe) Affliction would have three different detrimental symptoms. 

PROGNOSIS
A rating from "Poor" to "Excellent" describes the chance for your body to heal and remove an Affliction without treatment. The better the prognosis, the greater the chance an Affliction will heal. 

Afflictions have no chance to heal on their own until they reach "Stable" or better prognosis. A "Poor" prognosis comes with no chance for healing, but your prognosis will improve over time, from "Poor" to "Stable", "Stable" to "Good," and from "Good" to "Excellent," increasing the chance of your Affliction healing itself with each step.

So, for example, a Fractured Limb with an "Excellent" prognosis has a good chance of healing on its own without treatment. However, the same Affliction with a "Poor" prognosis cannot heal on its own, and will have to improve to "Stable" prognosis in order to do so. When the Fractured Limb improves to "Stable" prognosis, it has a chance to heal on its own, but not as high of a chance to do so compared to the "Excellent" prognosis. 

Note: gaining an Affliction you already have will reset its prognosis back to "Poor." For example, if you have a "Stable" Fractured Limb, and you fall from a great height and receive the Affliction again, the existing "Stable" Fractured Limb will revert to "Poor."

TREATMENT
Afflictions have icons representing the type of injury or illness you have contracted. Aid items that display the same icons when viewed in your Inventory will cure the matching Afflictions. For example, if you are suffering from Burns, you will have an orange flame icon on your watch. Heal Gel, an aid item that treats Burns, displays this same orange flame icon when viewed in your Inventory. This means that this item will cure your Burn Affliction.  

When viewing an aid item in your Inventory, its associated "Treatment" icon will be displayed under the item name, and the types of Afflictions it treats will be listed in its effects. 

DOCTORS
Doctors located throughout the Settled Systems can remove all your Afflictions.

===========ID 0x00033822: Spacer: Calling all Spacers. You know who you are. Because that's what they call us, isn't it? The ones in charge. The ones who never respected us. The Freestar Collective. The United Colonies. Even the Crimson Fleet and Ecliptic.

They see us as the leftovers, the unaligned, "space scum" running rampant across the Settled Systems. And you know what? Maybe they're right. But so what. We matter just as much as they do. We deserve... just as much as they do.

A lot of you have been all over. You've seen the empty buildings. Labs, factories, whatever. They're out there, lots of them, abandoned after the Colony War.

And those others? They want them. They're taking them, and everything inside. Are you going to let them do that? You going to let them get away with that? I'm not. I want my fair share. And I don't know about you... but I'm ready to take it.
===========ID 0x00033825: Structural components are largely cosmetic, and allow you to modify your ship's shape, size, personality and silhouette.
===========ID 0x00033827: My investigation of the First continues. When I arrived at Arcturus II to check out an abandoned mech factory, I was attacked by mercenary patrol ships. This would seem to confirm Marshal Blake's guess that the factory is indeed the First's base of operations.
===========ID 0x00033828: The Ebbside Strikers are a local gang that are holed up at Madam Sauvage's Place. Apparently they've been taking a beating from the Disciples, a rival gang. Maybe the Strikers could use some help against them?
===========ID 0x0003382A: I'm in pursuit of Maya Cruz, a technical genius and senior member of the First. She'd been staying at the Clinic under an alias, but was warned that the Freestar Rangers were looking for her and fled to her hideout, an asteroid mine in the Sakharov system.
===========ID 0x0003383C: Structural components are largely cosmetic, and allow you to modify your ship's shape, size, personality and silhouette.

===========ID 0x00033881: Only authorized personnel can use this.
===========ID 0x00033883: I refused to do Benjamin Bayu a favor to get permission to enter the Seokguh Syndicate's hideout. I'll need to to find a way inside on my own and be careful.
===========ID 0x000338A7: Ularu wouldn't confess to being the mole. I need to report to Dalton and give him Imogene's evidence slate.
===========ID 0x000338A8: I refused to do Benjamin Bayu a favor to get permission to enter the Seokguh Syndicate's hideout. I'll need to to find a way inside on my own and be careful.
===========ID 0x000338AE: A strange, homemade chem concoction. Users may experience a "slow motion"-like sensation coupled with intense rage.
===========ID 0x000338B0: A complete system purge, removing diseases and poisons and treating injuries of any sort. Very tiring to use.
===========ID 0x000338B2: Combines the effects of antibiotics and heal paste. Used for treating afflictions.

===========ID 0x00033A7F: I need to get inside the Infinity LTD building. I can either use my assigned identity at the entrance or find the roof access door. Once inside, Imogene gave me a locker keycard so I can obtain an R&D uniform and ID which can help me move about easier.
===========ID 0x00033B4C: +20 carry capacity.
===========ID 0x00033B4E: Drain 75% less O2 when running while encumbered.
===========ID 0x00033B50: -10% incoming Physical, Energy, and EM damage.
===========ID 0x00033B57: I've granted Hadrian remote access to the security hub. She discovered a system I can use to track the Terrormorph around the facility. First, though, I need to tune the system to the right frequency - 183.5.
===========ID 0x00033B58: I tuned the livestock tracking system to 183.5, but it got the attention of the Terrormorph, which is now on the move. Hadrian suggested I try not to fight it, and instead power up the facility's turrets by throwing the breakers on each building.
===========ID 0x00033B67: I'm sick and tired of Lillian Hart breathing down our neck, so it's time to end her once and for all. Use the abandoned supply depot on Andromas III and drop some breadcrumbs to lead her there. Call it a "weapons cache" or whatever you want. She won't be able to resist. Once she trips the alarms, have your crew jump her, and kill her. That will give us one less Ranger to worry about.

And Valerie, don't screw this up, or you're going to find yourself floating on the wrong side of an airlock.
===========ID 0x00033B70: I should speak to Commander Tuala so I can officially start working for the Vanguard.
===========ID 0x00033B71: Apparently there's an oath I need to take before I can start working with the Vanguard. Commander Tuala said I should follow him so he can administer it.
===========ID 0x00033B72: I retrieved some information from Simon on someone named Stanley McMillan. I need to examine the slates to see what I can learn in order to get my hands on Project Dominion.
===========ID 0x00033B73: After boarding the Datura to talk to Malai, I chose to attack. I'll have to kill her in order to retrieve her gun, Ember, for Simon.
===========ID 0x00033B74: After boarding the Datura to talk to Malai, she revealed she never intended to hand over her gun, Ember, to begin with. I'll have to kill her in order to retrieve it for Simon.
===========ID 0x00033B75: I need to retrieve Malai's gun, Ember, and bring it back to Simon in Cydonia in exchange for the information he has on Project Dominion.
===========ID 0x00033B76: I've disabled the Warlock's engines. Now I should be able to board his ship and see if I can't capture its pilot!
===========ID 0x00033BBB: Andreja faced more hardship in her life than most will ever know. She bore it with dignity, honor, and a fierce determination that guided her every action.
Though only with us a brief time, her contributions to Constellation were immeasurable, and we are proud to call her family.

May she find peace among the stars, and in whatever lies beyond.
===========ID 0x00033BBD: For Sam Coe. A rebel in his youth, and a father at his best. Sam shot straight from the hip, and rarely missed his mark. If he did he meant no harm, unless they had it coming. 

In his time, Sam walked among the stars, from the ranger badge on his chest to the constellations in the sky. But he never spent too much time gazing -- he lived for his daughter Cora, whose light was so much brighter.
===========ID 0x00033BBF: In memory of Barrett, a loving husband and fearless explorer. A friend to everyone, even his enemies. Fluent in the argot of science and the science of charm, in his time he discovered countless worlds and chronicled many an adventure, none greater than his own.
===========ID 0x00033BC0: Ambassador Radcliff is dead. I'll need to find another route to acquire the Freestar Archival Code.
===========ID 0x00033BCA: You can now build the Mounted Ashta at your Outposts.
===========ID 0x00033BCC: Supervisor's Log. Supplemental. Still day two of Argos Extractors' Vectera dig, Freestar Collective claim ID Beta 7548 Alpha.

As far as anyone knows, this is just another ore run. Vectera's got enough mid-level veins to keep everyone working, and not asking questions.

I've told Heller everything he needs to know, which is pretty much everything I know -- that this is another one of Barrett's "special orders." He made good with the payment for Kazaal, even if it was a bust. This time, I'm not so sure. 

This place is giving me the willies. I think we're going to find... something. I just have no idea what it could be... or why Barrett might want it. But those sweet Constellation credits mean we dig our holes and keep our mouths shut, and I'm okay with that.

Hopefully, between Barrett's mysterious "thing" and the ore itself, we'll be done with this rock in five days, when the transport is SUPPOSED to come back for extraction... 
===========ID 0x00033BCD: This is the personal log of Lin's amazing right-hand man. That's me, Heller.

Another day, another giant rock. The rock currently in question is Vectera, which is... eh. It's a moon. It's in space. It's got ore. Like the last hundred.

Unless you're me, and can appreciate the beautiful distinctions between neodymium, vanadium and iridium. I love these clowns, but most of them can't tell iron from lead.
===========ID 0x00033BCE: Supervisor's Log. It's day two of Argos Extractors' Vectera dig, Freestar Collective claim ID Beta 7548 Alpha.

Site setup was fairly painless. New record for us -- 18 hours, including the elevator. The prefabs are starting to show their age, though. Time to re-budget for new equipment... again.

The crew is good. Spirits are high enough. Heller is a pain in my ass, as always, and completely indispensable. What's the saying? "The problem is I love him... and he knows it."

Calvert remains the weak link. You just can't train away stupid. But she's got a daughter on Mars or someplace and needs the creds, so she gets one more chance.

If she does wash out in the end, we've still got the Dusty, and there's definitely some promise there.
===========ID 0x00033BCF: Personal log. Heller. Argos Extractors.

I figured Vectera for your standard moon. Looks like I was... misinformed. Lin just filled me in on what we're REALLY doing here.

Looks like Lin's got another, what's the word she used? "Discreet" contract. With that Barrett guy. He says there's something special here, and he's paying top dollar for us to find it, rip it out, and deliver it, no questions asked.

I have of course been honoring this arrangement by asking Lin a ton of questions. She's playing it close to the her sweaty old vest, as usual. 

But a guy does have to wonder -- what the hell does "special" even mean in this case? We're on a moon. In the middle of nowhere.

Either this guy wants to make jewelry from some rare space diamonds, or there's some kind of ancient alien death weapon buried here.

If it's diamonds, I'm totally stealing one to give to Jennifer. Or Carlos. Or Nia. And if it's a death weapon, I get to shoot it first. Those are my terms!
===========ID 0x00033BFD: The Ambassador has agreed to help me. I should follow him.
===========ID 0x00033BFE: I killed Ambassador Bal'mor. I'll need to collect the Va'ruun Archival Code myself.
===========ID 0x00033BFF: Mathis and I discovered that Jasper Kryx had a cell in D-Block. We've decided to head that direction and see if we can locate any useful information.
===========ID 0x00033C00: Mathis still insists we should betray Delgado and keep Kryx's information to ourselves. In the meantime, we're still exploring D-Block.
===========ID 0x00033C01: Yuko told me Imogene was last seen at Frankie's Grab & Go. She strongly suggested I speak to Benjamin Bayu about getting permission to enter since Frankie's is a Seokguh Syndicate hideout.
===========ID 0x00033C02: Yuko told me Imogene was last seen at Frankie's Grab & Go, but she strongly suggested I speak to Dalton before trying to find her.
===========ID 0x00033C03: I need to find Imogene at Frankie's Grab & Go which is also known to be a major Seokguh Syndicate hideout.
===========ID 0x00033C04: I gained access to the secure wing in the Clinic. I need to figure out where the rothicite shipment is and discover why Infinity LTD sent it here.

===========ID 0x00033C2C: I convinced Lucas to give me access to his computer. I can use this opportunity to run the Overseer Program.
===========ID 0x00033C2D: I spoke to Lucas, but I need to refocus on my goals: running the Overseer Program on Lucas and Faye's computers and finding the Internal Neuroamp Prototype. I've made progress, but still have work to do.
===========ID 0x00033C2E: I spoke to Lucas, but I need to refocus on my goals: running the Overseer Program on Lucas and Faye's computers and finding the Internal Neuroamp Prototype.
===========ID 0x00033C2F: I convinced Nina to set up a meeting for me with Lucas which gave me access to the Executive floor. I can find and speak to him in his office, but my main goal is to find the Internal Neuroamp Prototype on the Research and Development floor.
===========ID 0x00033C30: I convinced Nina to set up a meeting for me with Lucas which gave me access to the Executive floor. I can find and speak to him in his office, but my main goal is to run the Overseer Program on Faye's computer on the Research and Development floor.
===========ID 0x00033C31: I convinced Nina to set up a meeting for me with Lucas which gave me access to the Executive floor.

===========ID 0x00033C32: I convinced Nina to set up a meeting for me with Lucas which gave me access to the Executive floor. I should see if I can use this opportunity to run the Overseer Program on his computer. 
===========ID 0x00033C33: Dalton finished created an updated Overseer program after removing some malicious code that Ularu had added to frame Masako. I should speak to him about what to do next.
===========ID 0x00033C34: I gave Dalton the Overseer program that Ularu wrote. I should wait for him to finish examining it.
===========ID 0x00033C3A: The Crew Station allows you to assign Crew to your outpost, which can provide various benefits depending on their skills.

You can assign Crew to your Outpost by going to Data Menu -> Ship Menu -> Crew.
===========ID 0x00033C3B: Yuko spoke to me about my failure to eliminate the person I was sent to kill. She told me my secret is safe with her and her team. I can report to Ularu now and tell her the assignment is complete.
===========ID 0x00033C3C: Kaiser and I are going to put down Unit 99! Time to head in and raise hell!
===========ID 0x00033C5D:

===========ID 0x00033C63: I took care of Ecliptic. Time to speak to Kaiser about how to proceed.

===========ID 0x00033D77: Contrabands are items that have been deemed illegal throughout the Settled Systems. You will oftentimes be scanned for Contraband by security when jumping into a planet's orbit. If you are caught carrying Contraband, either on your person or in your ship, security will attempt to arrest you. However, there are ways to smuggle Contraband past these scans. For more info, see the "Smuggling" entry. 

Stolen Items are any items that were taken illegally from an owner. Unlike Contraband, security will not scan you for Stolen Items, but will attempt to arrest you if you are caught stealing something. For more info, see the "Crime" entry. 

Items are considered owned if they have a red icon next to their name when viewed in the world. If an item is stolen, it will have the same red icon on it when viewed in your Inventory. Contraband will have a yellow icon both in your Inventory and when you see it in the world. 

It is illegal to carry Contraband and Stolen Items. All of your Stolen Items and Contraband will be confiscated and removed from your inventory if you are arrested for a crime. 
===========ID 0x00033D7A: The hunt for Kryx's Legacy is on! The information from the Lock seems concrete enough that Delgado wants me to infiltrate GalBank to find out more about their long-lost transport. I'm to head to the Siren of the Stars, a Trident Starliner with a GalBank VIP aboard.

I need to refocus on my goals: running the Overseer Program on Lucas and Faye's computers and finding the Internal Neuroamp Prototype. I've made progress, but still have work to do.
