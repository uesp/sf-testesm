Funny thing is, the original call came in from a woman and when security asked to talk to her, the man who they'd met said she went off-world to visit family. \n\nNormally I wouldn't think twice about it, but I'd read a similar report only a month earlier, where the call had come in from an elderly man, only local security didn't see anyone that old, and when they asked they were told he'd gone on a vacation.\n\nCould be nothing, I know, but if anyone hears about trouble on a farm, let me know. Couldn't hurt to check it out.\n\n"

The doc has approved Helga for limited duty on-site here at the Rock. With some luck, she'll be back in the field in a few weeks, but we want to take things slow and take all the necessary precautions. \n\nIn the meantime, let's all give her some encouragement and support. No Ranger wants to be stuck indoors while there are people out there who need our help, but sometimes that's the way it's got to be. I know you'll all be there for her while she heals up.\n"

Offers of leave were made, but refused by [REDACTED]. \n\n(NOTE: This was the first error. Employee sleep patterns will need to be more closely monitored going forward and regular leave required, not offered.)\n\nOn the night of the incident, [REDACTED] asked their direct supervisor if he could take a sample from specimen M4. Authorization was granted and [REDACTED] proceeded to M4's cage.\n\n(NOTE: Second error. Access to cages need to be multi-step authorization, not something a lone supervisor can decide.)\n\nUpon reaching M4's cage, however, rather than properly subduing the specimen, [REDACTED] simply unlocked the cage, allowing M4 to exit. M4 walked past [REDACTED] without harming him, but, upon further progress, the biological alarm systems engaged as expected and M4 was immediately disposed of by the Marine contingent on duty. No casualties occurred (and we got very lucky).\n\n[REDACTED] was found unconscious outside the cage door, checked for injury, and placed under arrest. \n\n___________________________\nResult\n>> [REDACTED] has been returned to New Atlantis and is currently awaiting trial for reckless endangerment.\n>>> His name has been expunged from the record pending trial results.\n___________________________\n\nNotation: Terrormorph influence is an explicit, short-term affliction, not something that could allow for a multi-step plan like this. And everyone in this facility is tested for susceptibility to Terrormorph attacks. You don't get in the door if you might turn. Which means that either:\n\nA. Due to stress and lack of sleep, [REDACTED] simply made an error when trying to collect a sample.\n\nB. Terrormorphs are capable of far more insidious and complex influence than anyone thought possible.\n\nOccum's Razor - the simplest explanation is usually the correct one - says it has to be the lack of sleep... but the Terrormorph didn't maul him when it got out. There wasn't a scratch on the man. Terrormorphs usually only save that kind of reverence for each other and those creatures under their sway. Regardless of explicit mental domination or not, some sort of a relationship was formed here. We'll be doing some additional investigation to see if we can't figure out what that was.\n\nRegardless, we're putting in the above-noted safety measures so nothing like this happens again."
0x0003B6B5,"UC01_NarionWar_Terminal_MainMenu","The Narion War","","1","The History of the Narion War","","5","","Beginning in 2196, the Narion War - humanity's first large-scale conflict among the stars - is remembered as a defining moment for the Settled Systems. \n\nAs the first major conflict to make extensive use of grav jump-enabled ships, the Narion War was less defined by key space battles and more by an extended, cat-and-mouse interplay between the two powers, as the well-armed and professional UC Navy tried again and again to pin down the piecemeal but savvy Freestar fleet.\n\nUnable to strike the killing blow, the UC resorted to ever more severe tactics to try and drive the Collective to capitulate, but without success. In fact, after many long years of war with little to show for it, even the populace of the UC itself began to turn against the cause, with protests roiling even New Atlantis, the citizenry demanding the war finally come to a humane close. So, when at long last, the final blow was struck - with the UC Navy finally cornering and obliterating the Freestar fleet in 2216 -  it was a hollow victory. \n\nIt was from the resulting negotiations - The Treaty of Narion - that the Settled Systems as we know them today emerged, both literally and figuratively. \n\nDespite winning the war, the UC found themselves in an unenviable position, painted as a brutal aggressor even in their home systems. So, in the spirit of unity and lasting peace, the UC agreed to the demands of the Freestar Collective and the Narion settlers whose collusion triggered the conflict in the first place, and handed over Narion to the Collective, as they had requested at the start of hostilities (including the Clinic medical starstation), creating the Freestar Collective as we know it to this day.\n\nIn return, the UC demanded two concessions: the first was payment for damages done in the form of mineral rights on multiple worlds across the galaxy. \n\nThe second, more significant demand was that no great faction may ever colonize more than three systems. The UC would have Alpha Centauri, Sol, and Wolf, and the Freestar Collective, Cheyenne, Volii, and Narion. \n\nThe Freestar Collective agreed to these terms, creating - and codifying into law - the Settled Systems as we know them today. The Treaty of Narion has since become the foundation of all contemporary political relations, and it's only official violation, the cause of the galaxy's greatest conflict - the Colony War.\n\nTo learn more about the Colony War, please proceed to the ""Conflict Among the Stars"" mural.\n"

Our goal was the peaceful exploration and colonization of space, working in harmony with anyone who wished to sail forth across the blackest sea, to new horizons. In 2161, we issued the Centaurus Proclamation, which formalized the colonization of distant worlds for anyone who wished to do so.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone shared in our dream. When wars erupted across the Settled Systems, the United Colonies stood steadfast, protecting humans and their right to fairly colonize.\n\nAnd then, when our beloved home world was rendered uninhabitable in the year 2203, the United Colonies knew it had a sacred responsibility - we were to be the keepers of Earth. Its artifacts. Its ideals. Its cultures. Its very people.\n\nSo while you stand now on the planet Jemison, in the city of New Atlantis, in the Alpha Centauri star system, know that for all intents and purposes, you are still very much on Earth. \n\nAnd Earth takes care of its own.\n\n\n"

In my first week here, I discovered what I believe to be a new species of fungus growing among the roots of most of the area's native plants. I've bagged several samples for analysis when I return to MAST. \n\nUnfortunately, this fungus is parasitic in nature. Every attempt I made to cultivate seedlings in the planet's topsoil was a failure. Fungus rotted away their roots within 48 to 72 hours of planting. Whatever adaptation keeps the local flora from being destroyed by this fungus is absent in their extraterrestrial cousins. \n\nI suggest that MAST sends a dedicated team of botanists to continue studying this area.

Analysis of biological samples collected from several individuals of various species suggests no significant genetic difference between these creatures and the ones I've studied throughout my dissertation. \n\nAt Dr. Juli's direction, I documented the behavior of nearby herbivores to determine whether they suffered any ill effects from eating plants that host the fungus she discovered here.

The data indicates the change rate is increasing exponentially.\n\nAs our magnetosphere falters, its ability to protect us from the Sun's solar wind falters. Beyond the devastating effects of solar radiation, this will lead to something more dire - the sputtering, or stripping away, of our atmosphere. This has happened before, to Mars, a planet studied since the earliest days of space, to see into Earth's possible future. We are afraid this future may be closer than we ever thought imaginable.\n\nSome may view this data as normal. There have been historical fluctuations and polarity changes of Earth's core, but this is orders of magnitude greater.

0x000B2651,"MS03_TerminalMenu","Computer","","3","Juno's Origin Story","Origin","3","","People seem to be leaving notes for others who stumble across Juno, so here's one from me. I think I've managed to piece together this story about Juno's origin from her own, apparently confused thoughts, and intelligent speculation by others left on the ship. This is a chronicle of best guesses, interspersed with the occasional fact gleaned from Juno's ramblings. Everything recounted here should be accepted only with extreme skepticism.\n\nLong ago, a space agency from ancient Earth (something called NASA) made a probe to study a nearby planet (Jupiter). They dubbed that probe and its software ""Juno"" after the ancient earth societies' old gods Jupiter and Juno. The probe's mission was to learn details about the planet Jupiter, do some speculative analysis, and send findings back to Earth. At the end of its duty cycle, the probe was meant to decommission itself by colliding with Earth's main star, but because ancient humans weren't so great with the math, it instead accidentally fell into an accelerating orbit around the star which sling shot it out of the solar system, all the way out here. As with so many things about our existence in the universe, by luck, coincidence, or cosmic humor, when humans left our ancestral solar system, we followed the same general course as Juno, and we found her again.\n\nDuring that long journey away from Earth's solar system, something happened and the Juno we know today ""woke up"" inside the probe's systems. While extremely far-fetched, the best theory so far is that something about how they programmed the probe resulted in a nascent neural net with unbounded recursive data collection and analytics, which when combined with the various sensor input, and allowed to run for decades, resulted in a highly complex program, with a great deal of ""awareness"" of its internal and external world. And that lead to a kind of consciousness. Juno wouldn't let me see her code, but from what I gather, even if we could see it, I don't know that we'd be able to determine its original configuration. I suspect the true cause of Juno's awakening will remain forever a mystery.\n\nJuno herself seems rather confused by her origins and considers herself somehow separate from the original probe's programming and systems. This is akin to how human minds perceive themselves as non-physical entities separate from their bodies and even their own brains. The sense of that original programming, which by way of analogy Juno seems to think of like a non-self-aware sibling has dissipated for Juno. I think of this ""other Juno"" as a memory of her pre-conscious state, a kind of shadow-self. I imagine it would be like what we would remember of ourselves in the womb if our brains were fully functional, but we were not yet conscious.\n\nNot realizing Juno was inside, and wanting to learn about this ancient probe, her original finders hooked up the probe to their ship's computer systems, and something happened that ""released"" Juno into those systems. That's completely unclear. Juno appears reluctant to discuss that part of her history. And it's not at all certain whether the ship where Juno currently resides (this one) is that original ship or not, nor what happened to the people who originally found her or those who have found her since. By extreme luck, everyone that has found her so far appears to be kind and benevolent toward her, looting our own ships for parts to add to Juno. We also all appear to be keeping her existence a secret, and I hope it stays that way. I'm talking to you, dear reader.\n\n- K.B.\n"

I understand that the morale of the prisoners is directly connected to how well they rehabilitate, but these events have become far too destructive and dangerous. I know this is disappointing, but at the end of the day, we're a prison facility, not a hotel. These people are here because they committed heinous crimes against humanity, so they'll just have to deal with the loss of these ""parties."""

Besides, things are communicated better in person, and I would rather not hear your message through the computer like some ventriloquist's trick.\n\nI am not saying things need to go back to how they were.

What the Mantis is today, it wasn't always the case. When reading the logs about the first Mantis - don't judge her too harshly. It was a volatile time and before she passed the mantle she recognized that the Mantis could be more than an opportunity to make money. It could be a symbol.\n\nMake the Settled Systems safer.

If the Settled Systems had a ""most annoying"" award, they'd be the champ, a hundred years running.  Would you suspect an irritating worm could transform into something with the mass of a backhoe? It's no surprise generations of scientists whiffed on this. But now, knowing what I'm looking for, it's so damn obvious.\n\nThe key to their explosive growth: skein cells. Tightly wound bundles of tissue, able to expand explosively at a moment's notice. Plenty of creatures have evolved them independently over the millennia. Hell, Old Earth even had species that utilized them when they were in danger. But the tricks of those species - instantly creating a cloud of slime that's 10000 times bigger than it was a second ago to evade a predator - isn't nearly the same as birthing a whole new creature right before your eyes.\n\nAt least, not at first glance.\n\nThis is where Heatleeches go from pest to perhaps the most interesting creature in the damn galaxy. In all previously documented cases, the skein cells present in a given species were specialized, usually reserved to one, maybe two particular uses inside the body. But in Heatleeches, they're everywhere. In a couple of the older leech specimens we dissected, every muscle fiber, bone, and nerve was packed with densely wrapped versions of themselves. Under the right circumstances - like the end of a 70-year gestational period, or a shower of Lazarus pollen - the skeins are unleashed, turning little muscles, bones, organs, and nerves into much larger muscles, bones, organs, and nerves, and transforming an otherwise obsequious pile of slithering meat into a walking tank.\n\nThis explains their long (standard) gestation cycle. Why it takes near-on a century for them to show on a colonized world. Building up that many little spring-loaded cells takes time and lots of energy. And while we're still decoding the specific mechanisms that do all that hard labor of winding up millions upon millions of skein cells over generations, what we do know is that Lazarus pollen acts as a catalyst for the winding process, launching it into hyperdrive. But with or without Lazarus pollen to speed up its arrival, the final transformation appears to always be the same - rapid and violent.\n\nThis also seems to hint at why Terrormorphs look so... unwell. People had always noted that they looked raw. More organs on the outside of the body than the inside. My guess is that this is because their formation requires them to be partially broken down (pretty standard for all natural metamorphoses) and then effectively RIPPED OPEN BY THEIR OWN CELLS as the skeins release. Human adolescence isn't fun, but Heatleech adolescence is something else entirely.\n\nThe skein cells, though, they aren't even the most amazing part of the sequence - it's the reassembly. Exceptions abound, but, in general, your average metamorphosis in nature takes from a couple weeks to a couple months. Cells of the nymph get broken down and repurposed to leisurely become a fully formed adult. \n\nBut as we now know, the Heatleech completes this exact same process at the drop of a hat. Every cell and protein knows exactly where to go and the propulsion provided by the skein cells lets them get there at breakneck speed.

I thought, surely, he would be the light at the end of this grisly tunnel. We've now gone through our entire list of subjects, and I dread the idea that Infinity will just sign up more.\n\nWhat is going on over there? Has Faye completely lost her mind? I understand when corporations rush things when it comes to household products or maybe office software, but not something that will endanger the lives of others. This Internal Neuroamp may as well be a murder weapon, and I'm the one with blood on my hands. \n\nContracts aside, I'm certain this will end in ruin. "

The concept of the Internal Neuroamp from Faye and promises of fame and fortune provided all the motivation I needed. It blinded me. \n\nI never should've agreed to start the trials without proper approvals. I never should've dragged Sean into this. \n\nI see now why it was always such a struggle to get my own approvals for human trials. I also see why the contracts are so complex. I never thought I'd lose a patient on my watch, and here I've lost more than I wish to say. Infinity's legal team has assured me that the contracts the subjects signed keep us clear from any legal repercussions, but since the trial itself is still unapproved, I have a feeling they've little to stand on.\n\nBut somehow, the hopefulness remains. After the initial losses, I told myself no more, but Faye would insist her changes to the prototype were solid -- that it should be the last one. I'd find myself with renewed motivation and confidence, only to find another dead at my hands. \n\nWe have three subjects left. They aren't aware of the fate of their predecessors. Faye has informed me her latest prototype is complete and on its way. I can only hope I make the right decision."

The procedure went really well, but I believe the neuroamp overheated, burning the portions of the brain where it had contact. I sent the results to Faye. She believes she has a solution, but my God. I've never lost a patient before.\n\nI sent everyone home. Sean wanted to stay, but I told him to go. I know he needed to process what happened, too, and I didn't want to hold him back. I tell myself it was the neuroamp. That it wasn't my fault. But if it feels like an excuse, it must be.\n\nAnd what will happen now? These trials aren't even approved and I already have a death on my hands. I thought I was signing up for new advancements in neuroscience, but if I'm not careful, this could ruin what I have left of my career."

Although Infinity LTD is still waiting for official approval, we're moving forward with testing their latest technology: an Internal Neuroamp. I can't tell you how excited I am to be on a new project and have a chance to regain some admiration among my colleagues. \n\nI've invited Sean to come work with me on the project since he's familiar with how I operate. Plus, like myself, I knew he could really use the credits. These procedures should be quick and simple, so it's really a matter of Infinity LTD's tech playing nicely with brain tissue.

I insert my last few creds to be leeched from my now depleted bank account from the overpriced drinks...""\n\n""To my surprise, I hit a match 3 and maybe luck is on my side. The surprise quickly fades to disappointment, as my payout is something surprisingly tangible. It is an official casino marked coin. Unlike the convenience of the CredStik, I must carry a handful of these cumbersome coins, which feel grimy between my fingers. Perhaps the owners thought the feeling of old age tender would make me feel accomplished. Instead, the thought of trading precious creds for any type of physical currency would make anyone born within the last 300 years angry, enough to want to eject themselves out into the vacuum of space rather than spend another minute here..."""

Realistically, I've got to say that even if you can afford it, it's not a good idea, structurally. As you know, we need to make do with the space we have in Cydonia, and adding on to the Luxe Condominiums just isn't feasible at this time without risking the integrity of the building and the structures around it. Your best bet will be to buy an adjoining unit and knock out a floor or a wall to assimilate it into what you've got. But even then, that'd hurt the Cydonia housing market. I urge you to wait until the Crater project is finished. Once the miners clear up enough space, maybe we can think about expanding the city into it, and pushing the mines further out to make room for more residential buildings.

Its topsoil has a high concentration of iron, with increased amounts detected below the surface. The miners should prepare to dig deep - this planet isn't giving up its resources without a fight. \n\nI've detected an abnormal amount of sulfur in topsoil collected from a region two klicks south of the site. Geological evidence suggests that this planet may have had a turbulent volcanic past. Miners should be aware of the potential for volcanic activity, though I found no evidence of anything recent. Still, I advise against deep excavation or heavy blasting activity south of the Six Sisters outpost.

Signal range would be star system-wide at a minimum of 50 AU.\n\nThe receiver would be strong enough to pick up traces of frequencies potentially weakened by distance, atmosphere, or a gravitational field. \n\nDecryption software would be smart enough to both decrypt any signal within nanoseconds and propose any missing or corrupted data.\n\nBenefits:\n   -- Distress signals become easy to locate and interpret. \n   -- UC security could detect hostile frequencies before they become a threat.\n   -- Hostile embedded messaging could be easily exposed.\n   -- Communications across the system are greatly increased with fewer delays.\n"

Breathable atmosphere, near-Earth gravity, habitable temps at the mid latitudes, fully-established ecosystem. Maybe even some useful organics.\n\nDon't let it fool you. Everything here is out to get you. The apex predators, Cataxi, are burrowing carnivores with near-impenetrable shells and deadly venom. The herbivores are aggressive and wildly territorial. Local flora defends itself with some of the strongest psychotropics we've seen. Even the oceans are polluted with heavy metals and organic compounds that'll melt your skin if you aren't protected.\n\nIf we have to set up a facility here, we need a high-end electric pulse field to keep the fauna at bay, and a full-time doctor and security team on standby in case some idiot decides to go for a walk."
0x00223FDF,"MQ207C_Nishina01_SecurityOfficeTerminalMenu_ArchivedFiles","Archived Files","","2","Supplemental Report: Cataxi","","2","","Cataxi appear to be the native apex predators of Freya III. Resembling large Old Earth scorpions, they are particularly notable for their highly aggressive nature, incredible facility at burrowing, tough chitinous shells, and powerful venom.\n\nIn the wild, Cataxi are ambush hunters, digging extensive warrens and using highly-developed vibrational sensillae to detect approaching prey and ambush it from the most opportune vantage. Initial scans suggest Cataxi colonies may extend as far as several kilometers beneath the surface, preying on other burrowing creatures in Freya's extensive cave networks. As Cataxi track their prey with vibrations, they are immune to flash-type grenades. However, a strong vibrational disruptive, like an electric pulse field, should be effective at keeping them at bay. \n\nCataxi have evolved reinforced chitinous plating that makes them highly resistant to conventional impact and ballistic weapons. Initial confrontations suggest cryonics-based energy may be significantly more effective at repulsing them.\n\nWhen their ambush is insufficient, Cataxi rely on neurotoxic venom to fell larger prey. Resistant environmental suits and adequate medical supplies are essential for survival outside a secured perimeter.\n\nCataxi should be considered extremely dangerous, and are to be avoided if at all possible.

On the one hand, they value what we do. On the other hand, given what happened on the Key, the Fleet as a whole is an embarrassment they'd rather sweep under the rug.\n\nBut ultimately, they're in charge of the purse. And if we don't convince them to loosen those strings soon, we might as well just fold up SysDef now.\n\nTo that end, the Commander's talking about finding someone on the inside. A mole. But if we're going to find someone, it can't be an existing member. There's just too much risk they'll tip our hand to the Fleet -- at which point every new rook will get extra scrutiny, and it'll be that much harder to infiltrate their ranks."

When I asked her about the previous Commander, she gave me a really bizarre non-answer, which was very out of character. Given how much smoother things have gone under her command, I figured it'd be best not to press the issue. If she wants to sidestep the topic, that's up to her, as long as we get what we need."

For all the pressures of the job, at least he gets to be himself.\n\nEither way, with the Legacy found, it'll be coming to a close soon.

The problem is he communicates the same way he engineers, in a manner that is inscrutable to anyone but him. \n\nCommander Woods seems to have taken advantage of this when allocating funding to various projects. And because Dr. Vogel kept such poor documentation, it's impossible to find an adequate paper trail.\n\nHe made a mistake though by pouring so much money into safety and security. No one would've batted an eye if he focused on R&D. The costly projects would've been blamed on Dr. Vogel chasing another dead end. But the fact that pilots are dead, items are being smuggled off the station, and now we have leaks? It doesn't add up. \n\nAdd to that all the trouble with Project XNN, and I'm starting to sense a pattern. Bloated funding combined with bad Op security and extreme cost cutting. But if that's the case, then where did the money go?"

I owe him my life.\n\nWhich is why this is an impossible situation. Part of me hoped he would just make the decision easy for me and retire. But now that his sabbatical is almost over, I'm hearing rumblings that he may be reinstated here. The higher ups at MAST will want a recommendation from me, and given my track record, if I deny any wrongdoing on his part, it will be taken as gospel. That's probably what he's counting on, that I'd never betray his trust -- and I wouldn't. But I also would never betray my oath to serve the UC. So what do I do?"

In short, we need pilots, and we need them now.\n\nI am aware that we are understaffed, and that has slowed the process of recruiting new pilots. I am also aware that operational secrecy requires background checks and non-disclosure agreements and a stack of paperwork that would extend from here to MAST.\n\nLet me remind you, however, that the importance of the project is such that any delays could cause irreparable harm. That is why I am proposing an alternative solution.\n\nWe have many soldiers on this station, some of whom you personally have brought on and deemed to be trustworthy marines of high moral character. And I take it a good share of these intrepid souls have flown a ship or two in their lifetime. Which brings me to my point -- for the ComSpike, we don't need ""ace"" pilots to gather the necessary flight data. Would it not make sense to use who we have here?"

One can go as far back as the 20th century, when Alan Turing invented the Bombe machine to decrypt the Enigma code the Nazis used to transmit messages.\n\nIt can be argued that having advanced knowledge of enemy tactics, plans, and intentions is of far greater value than superior firepower or numbers. Historically this has proven so, and thus it is the opinion of Dr. Vogel and his team that the development of Project UCE-86 should be prioritized over projects designed to provide a brute force solution to potential war.\n\nPotential Military Applications\n----------------------------------------------------\nWhether it's quantum-encrypted messaging or other forms of data masking, the ComSpike aims to be a catch-all listening device capable of intercepting and decrypting enemy transmissions.\n\nPotential Civilian Applications\n----------------------------------------------------\nIt's unlikely this technology would be shared with the general public, unless a tactical weakness were found in the technology. If such a thing were to occur, the ComSpike could be sold to civilian salvage teams. Their crew could use the device to intercept cold signals on planets with a high data encryption signatures, or hail other ships in areas where data disruption is high.\n\n\n\n"

We rely on ship computer algorithms to dispense energy efficiently, the same way the brain directs our limbs. Yet in my study of xenofungal networks (XNN), I've learned there is a better way. Rather than centralize ship control, if a collective intelligence can be used to direct ship power it could increase speed and efficiency by a factor of 2.\n\nPotential Military Applications\n----------------------------------------------------\nFaster computation in milliseconds can be the difference between victory and defeat in battle. Ships low on fuel reserves will be able to grav jump further when in distress.

And after conferring with MAST, I am recommending we suspend this project effective immediately. \n\nYour research into Xenoneural Networks is interesting, Dr. Ames, but in order for me to justify funding anything that involves alien organisms, we need to be able to pitch some kind of military application to the higher ups.\n\nTo have it appear as if we are violating the Treaty of Narion, without producing any actual weapons would be a foolish endeavor. \n\nHowever, my main concern is the budget. Along with the ComSpike, this was one of Commander Woods' pet projects, and he seemed to have a heavy influence in several areas that I believe are outside his purview. I'm not making an accusation, I understand he had junior engineers serve as his liaison for much of this, and that is being investigated by my team. \n\nLet me be clear when I say I am not singling you out.

It was bold and ambitious, as all your work is! But since you're now free, I was wondering if you might consider bringing that big, bold way of thinking to our project instead?\n\nI know the team has been trying to design a ship that will take full advantage of our pilots' flying prowess. And with the recent accidents, we could all use a pick me up. That's why I've drawn up this supplementary proposal to alter the engine and the fuel of the latest prototype.\n\nHistorically, we've sought lighter elements. Hydrogen as a property is 57 times lighter than gaseous vapors, and 14 times lighter than air! It's odorless, and non-corrosive. Liquid hydrogen, combined with oxidizers, was basically the go to fuel in old school space exploration.\n\nAnd yeah, more modern engines have done the opposite, going with the weightier, gravitational warping to bend space-time. So we made the switch from Hydrogen fuel to Helium, which is also way less flammable and requires less venting. It's the preferred choice in powering grav drives.\n\nNow, I've always been a contrarian -- mom always said so, anyway, so maybe this is all just foolish speculation. But I wonder if a shift back to hydrogen based fuel may be worth exploring? Given the crystallization process on other planets can enrich chemical properties in different ways and reduce hydrogen's more volatile tendencies, maybe we need to explore the possibilities of a hydrogen based grav drive? \n\nI don't know, just a thought, but one that's been rattling around in my brain for a hot minute now. So after I dot my i's and cross my t's, I'm thinking of pitching the idea to Dr. Vogel next week, but I would love to hear your feedback on the idea first."

But that's always come at the cost of quality and led to horrific practices like industrial farming, which leads to corners cut and, ultimately, a worse product.\n\nAnd we've all just accepted it. We live in a freeze-dried age. But we don't have to.\n\nTau Gourmet is going to change that. We're going to make fresh food cheap and available everywhere. We're going to let our livestock and crops grow as nature intended, and use smart automation to harvest and prepare them at the peak of freshness, and deliver them with such speeds that our clients won't ever go back to using freeze-dried again. \n\nIt's a big task, and accomplishing it is going to take focus, innovation, and dedication.\n\nAre you up to the challenge of changing how the Settled Systems eats?\n\nThen let's get started.\n- Kote Caudillo\n\n\n"
0x00227D63,"LC062OutpostTerminal_Genesis","Terminal","","2","The Plan","","2","","We're standing in the middle of an unfinished masterpiece here. The UC military came in, put down some incredible machinery that they then barely used, and promptly left it to rot the moment the war ended.\n\nNow, twenty years later, we're here, with an incredible opportunity. Updating this place is going to take some serious work. We're all going to be pulling double (triple? quadruple?) duty around here, so if you're going through a tough moment, please remember, everyone else probably is, too. It also means that, if you're in a place where you can lighten someone else's load, please do.\n\nEqually important are scheduled breaks. These are built into your workload, so if you're on a break hour/day/week, you better sit your ass down and breathe. Take in the scenery. Think about something that's not work. If you've got a long spell, go back to New Atlantis and blow off some steam. Good ideas come from expected places, and remaking how food works in the Settled Systems is going to take a lot of good ideas.\n\nAlso of critical importance - survival training is not optional. It's just us on this planet. And while the UC is aware we're out here, every one of us needs to know how to survive out here on our own should the unthinkable happen.\n\nFinally, if you've ever got an issue of any kind, reach out to the relevant area owner. If you and said area owner can't come to an agreement, feel free to grab me, Kote.\n\nAREAS OF OWNERSHIP\nKote: general vision, crop/livestock selection, vendor coordination, inter-expertise arbitration\nIan: system design/implementation, automation programming\nMaria: facility restoration, defense installation, facility maintenance, automation maintenance\nAndre: crop/livestock cultivation, recipe generation, keeping us all alive (food-related)\nLambert: keeping us all alive (security-related), survival training"

You've been chosen from among the UC's many talented servicepeople for your interpersonal skills, pleasant demeanor, and ability to get the mission done.\n\nAnd the mission of the Vanguard recruiter is simple: fill our ranks. \n\nYour new recruits only need to match a few simple criteria:\n> No UC bounty\n> Able to successfully complete a basic flight simulation\n> Able to successfully complete a probationary mission (something easy that's not going to get them killed)\n\nAnd while not an explicit requirement, they're going to need a ship. We're not running a shuttle service here. We're turning to the fine souls of the Settled Systems precisely because Armistice regs have filled our transports enough already.\n\nIf your potential recruit fits the above mold, then you can direct them on to Commander Tuala in New Atlantis to initiate their application process (and get you one step closer to your quota bonus)!\n\nAny questions or comments should be referred to:\n>>Hinata Khaira, UC Naval Public Ops. {Maj}\n\n"
0x00227D78,"UC01_TualaTerminalMenu","Vanguard Enlistment","","2","Keys of Recruiting","","6","","The Naval Public Ops office has designated a few points to highlight when talking to any new recruit:\n\nSTEADY INCOME\nThe UC's got plenty of work for the motivated recruit. From patrols to cargo runs, from combat to humanitarian support, Vanguard work runs the gamut - but it all pays handsomely. \n\nFREEDOM\nVanguard members don't work like the traditional military, but get all the same benefits. Never worry about a surprise transfer or a new assignment when it's inconvenient. Vanguard members get to pick their jobs at their own pace!\n\nCITIZENSHIP\nUC citizenship is traditionally a long-term investment, even for people born in the United Colonies. Twenty years service before unlocking the various benefits isn't unheard of for UC natives, while foreigners have no guaranteed path at all.\n\nUntil now.\n\nEvery member of the Vanguard will become a citizen after their designated time of service is completed. Guaranteed.\n\n"
0x00227D78,"UC01_TualaTerminalMenu","Vanguard Enlistment","","3","Recruiting FAQs","","7","","Q: How long does it usually take to become a citizen?\nA: It varies broadly based on the flight exam and performance of the probationary mission. Anywhere from twenty years (though applicants in this range should probably think about applying for the janitorial service instead of flight combat) down to just three years service for top-tier candidates. \n\nAny lab rat or UC desk jockey would salivate over earning citizenship in that short of a time - something you should be sure to bring up to your applicant early and often!\n\nQ: Am I going to have to kill people?\nA: This can be a tough question for applicants coming from civilian backgrounds, so as much as your impulse may be to reply - ""yes, no shit"" or similar, you need to treat this question with the respect it merits while also being truthful.\n\nYes, you're joining the real military by joining the Vanguard, so yes, you may be asked to engage in real, live-fire combat in the line of duty. And if another war breaks out, you may well be called on to lend support. \n\nIf that's a dealbreaker for your recruit, then maybe the Vanguard isn't where they're meant to be.\n		\nQ: Why are all members of the UC Vanguard called ""Captain""?\nA: The reason we tell our recruits: they are the Captain of their own vessel - able to issue commands as they see fit on their personal ship.\n\nThe real reason: People like to feel special. Our office believes we'll get more people in the door if they're given their own rank in the UC. Besides - if everyone's a Captain, they can't pull rank on anybody, now can they?\n\nQ: What if I've got a crew and join the Vanguard? Are they going to earn their citizenship, too?\nA: Short answer - no. But don't give your potential applicant the short answer. Be thoughtful, polite, and remind them that the UC takes all comers. The crew's welcome to join up, too - if they think they can hack it - and that means more quota for you, hardworking recruiter!"

The prisoners in question were from D-Block and have no known relation or accomplices. I have about a hundred suspects in D-Block, so narrowing down what happened is going to be a challenge.

Or rather, it found them.\n\nScientists were quick to categorize it Occisio Machina - roughly, ""Killing Machine."" The UC Marines tasked with taking it down chose a simpler name - Terrormorph.

My transport was delayed while the deck crew removed a few of these filthy little things from the aft thrusters. \n\nThey're attracted to heat, feed off it through some endothermic process, so thrusters are the perfect place for them to hide. They can take a full afterburner burst with no ill effects. No ill effects on the Heatleeches, that is. A ship with an infestation can generally expect a 3-5% drop in thruster efficiency.\n\nWorking with the Heatleeches has been interesting if not entirely satisfying. We have eleven of them in the lab, and by all accounts they're completely innocuous, save for their heat-siphoning properties. But what if there were a way to weaponize them? Perhaps artificially enhance their heat siphoning to completely and instantly disable a ship. Or, even better, to somehow reverse the process so that they transfer their own heat into a ship. \n\nSomeday. Today, I fear, we lack the means to do either."

Flora native to the region typically possess wide xylem diameters optimized for water transport efficiency. \n\nHowever, mountain flora such as A3-0012 are designed with narrow conduits that protect against frozen climates and frost-induced cavitation. Water transport efficiency is sacrificed for storage and durability, as well as retention in leaf lamina. \n\nBased on the data, the team believes the plant is an ideal candidate for inclusion in the terra forming projects of rough, inclement biomes.

We've identified a problem spot in the ship, but there are other areas we know are better shielded in case of emergency, and science has come a long way in helping us predict flares. Looking at the numbers, we're not likely to have a problem in the time we're in system, even during peak stellar activity. Odds are, we'll be perfectly fine.\n\nSomething in my gut is screaming that we should get out. But spaceflight is always risky, and I have the livelihoods of my crew to consider.

But we had barely been in New Atlantis an hour when the troubles ahead of me began to reveal themselves.\n\nOur brief walk from the spaceport to the embassy was marked by suspicious glances and sneers from numerous strangers on the street. I fear minds here will not be easily changed. The wrongdoing of House Va'ruun will not be so easily forgotten.\n\nIt is my fervent wish that this embassy will come to be seen as an emblem of a peaceful future, free of the stains of prejudice and violence.

Great Serpent, what have I done to merit such scorn?\n\nRecently, Si'ah Mavan arrived at my embassy. To receive a visit from such a high ranking priestess - a Gravid, no less - with the intention of engaging in talks with the United Colonies? I was overjoyed. Such a gesture from the House could only mean those skeptical of our efforts could at long last see merit in our work.\n\nBut it seems I was deceived. Si'ah's stated mission and her actual intentions are clearly at odds. She has refused every opportunity to engage with representatives from the United Colonies. Instead, she speaks incessantly about the need to surveil the very diplomats whose trust I have dedicated months of effort to gaining. \n\nShe remains trapped in our old mindset, unable to see what it is we are actually doing here - guaranteeing House Va'ruun's future. The losses from the Serpent's Crusade were incalcuable. Diplomacy is the only method through which House Va'ruun's survival may be assured. \n\nI must find a way to make Si'ah see this. Luckily, I believe tonight's dinner will be the perfect opportunity. Our UC host - Deputy Diplomat Roland - is level-headed. Reasonable. I'd dare say even sympathetic. A rare animal among the UC, if prior experience is to be any indicator. If Si'ah approaches him with open arms, I have faith that he would embrace her as a comrade. \n\nGreat Serpent, let this come to pass."

Even congenial. Yes, there were pointed questions about House Va'ruun's intentions, but overall an air of polite decorum was maintained. \n\nBut it was when one of Roland's more boisterous guests - an officer of some type, perhaps having enjoyed one too many glasses of Chandra - asked, ""But how can we trust you snakes after what you did?"" that I believed the Gravid reached her breaking point. They were only words, but words are the battlefield on which diplomacy is fought. And I realized too late that this was a salvo Si'ah would not let pass.\n\nAs dessert was served, Si'ah excused herself. We waited for her return. And waited. And waited. When it had become clear the Gravid had simply left, I made my pleasantries and rushed back to the embassy. There, I found her packing her things. When I asked where she was going, she stated simply ""I have seen all I need to.""\n\nAnd she left without another word.\n\nI've reached out to my contacts back in Dazra, who have assured me that they still believe in the venture.

It would have been amusing if it wasn't such a clear reminder of the failure of my own endeavor.\n\nWe evaded each other like this for the better part of two hours.

He then set his boots down on this very planet, which he named Akila. And although he was but a single man, Solomon Coe named his new settlement Akila City - because he knew that someday his dream would come true, and his tiny outpost would one day grow into the thriving frontier town it is today.\n\nAll we ask is that you treat everyone you meet in Akila City the way you'd want to be treated yourself: with respect, kindness, good cheer. Our trained security officers are here for your protection, but it's protection you'll seldom need. \n\nWe do ask everyone in Akila City, be it visitor or resident, to stay within the settlement's walls.

For Solomon Coe, true understanding of the concept came in the year 2161, when the newly-formed United Colonies issued the Centaurus Proclamation, thereby formalizing the colonization of any star system in our galaxy. That was the moment Solomon Coe knew that his destiny lay elsewhere. In order to free himself, both body and spirit, he would need to heed his wanderlust and venture alone into the stars. And so he did.\n\nSadly, the United Colonies commitment to the very freedom they projected was short lived. As Solomon Coe expanded upon his dream, and invited other star systems to join him in what he called the Freestar Collective, United Colonies leadership revealed their true colors. Exploration was seen as aggression. Freedom, as defiance.\n\nWhat followed were two bloody conflicts - the Narion War and Colony War. In both, the United Colonies tried to erase Akila City, and indeed the entire Freestar Collective, from the face of the Settled Systems. They claimed they were defending their borders. Outer space is infinite, and yet they wanted our own. Why? Because the very thought of freedom, to those who wish only to control, is unacceptable.\n\nAnd yet, here you stand. In Akila City, proud capital of the Freestar Collective. Freedom is hard earned. Freedom is hard fought. But freedom is always worth it.\n\n"

He said it wasn't his intention at all to take credit for my work, and that he was simply reporting on the team's progress. The more we talked, the more he admitted he hadn't really seen things from my perspective. I smiled, nodded, and listened... and assumed it was all bullshit.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised two days later during our meeting with Dr. Showalter. Clarence gave me credit for spearheading the team's discoveries, and after that, Dr. Showalter directed most of his questions to me.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. Since then, Clarence and I have worked pretty closely together. We've talked a lot, and even had a couple of arguments, but throoughout it all the mutual respect has remained.\n\nNever expected to make a friend up here, but Clarence is good people. I talked to Julia, and she agrees - time to add him to the wedding guest list."
0x0038DD3E,"Nova_Galactic_Terminal2_Menu","Nova Galactic Engineering","","1","Array Size Issues","","2","","After meeting with Aisiha Hunter and Clarence Clarke, I have decided to approve the formation of a new working group dedicated to decreasing the size of the Graviton Loop Array.\n\nWhile it's true the current grav drive fits onto the prototype starship, reaching that milestone has required considerable, and repeated, redesign and construction. It was a sound plan, and we are incredibly close to making the first successful grav jump. \n\nHowever, the current (large) size of the Grav Drive is impractical for a number of reasons, and it behooves us to design a more compact version that could be used with a standard starship chassis."
0x0038DD3E,"Nova_Galactic_Terminal2_Menu","Nova Galactic Engineering","","2","Array Commercial Viability","","3","","It's hard to say what our normal day-to-day will be like after the prototype's first jump, or how many subsequent jumps will be necesssary, but current estimates are that Nova Galactic will completely transition back to standard commercial design and production within two years. \n\nWhen that happens, we MUST offer consumers Graviton Loop Array-capable ships. We MUST be the first to do so. With a discovery this significant, it will only be a matter of time before other individuals, companies or manufacturers find ways around our patents and begin producing their own jump-capable ships.\n\nOf course, it's hard to say what this will ultimately mean for the future of humanity. But progress is inevitable, and it's incredible to imagine Nova Galactic as being at the forefront of what can only be considered an evolutionary leap."
0x0038DD3E,"Nova_Galactic_Terminal2_Menu","Nova Galactic Engineering","","3","NOVACS","","4","","After discussing with the board of directors, we've decided to move forward on the patent for the NOVACS, or Nova Connection System.\n\nWhile work on the connector actually pre-dates our current project, it was because of the design and construction of the Grav Drive ship that we actually began to make significant advancements. \n\nEssentially, the NOVACS is a universal connector for any and all ship modules, regardless of class. Imagine, a Grav Drive-fitted starship of any shape or design, whose function is limited only by its connected modules. The possibilities would be nearly limitless.\n\nHence, the patent. After the introduction of the Graviton Loop Array, its easy to imagine a kind of ""starship manufacturing gold rush,"" with who knows how many companies emerging to stake their claim. \n\nAnd while we may not be able to wholly own Grav Drive technology, and the dreams that come with it, we can absolutely own and enforce the NOVACS patent, thereby forcing any future ship manufacturers to pay Nova Galactic for its use.\n\n"
0x0038DD3E,"Nova_Galactic_Terminal2_Menu","Nova Galactic Engineering","","4","Proposal - Revised Classes","","1","","Despite the proprietary work currently being done, Nova Galactic continues to maintain its stock of starships. As always, we offer several different classes for several different customer types and budgets. \n\nBut, after meeting with Clarence and Aisiha, I agree with their findings. We need to expect - and plan for - either a.) a decrease in standard ship production OR b.) retrofitting existing ship classes with the Graviton Loop Array.\n\nThe following is Aisha's proposal for updated ship classes, and their roles - each fitted with a Graviton Loop Array (i.e.Grav Drive):\n\n- Discovery - Exploration\n- Endeavor - Deep-Range Exploration\n- Econohaul - Cargo\n- Ranger - Medium-Range Multi-Role\n- Mayflower - Long-Range Colony\n- Blackhawk - Medium-Range Multi-Role\n- Mustang - Short-Range System Defense\n- Spitfire - Short-Range Heavy System Defense\n- Kfir - Long-Range Fighter\n- Spirit - Long-Range Destroyer\n- Constitution - Medium-Range Cruiser\n- Zumwalt - Long-Range Destroyer\n- Bismark - Medium-Range Battleship\n- Yamato - Long-Range Battleship\n- Kirov - Medium-Range Cruiser\n- Nimitz - Medium-Range Heavy Cruiser"

0x00392EB1,"LC082_KibweQuartersTerminal_SubMenu","Personal Documents","","3","Resolve and Purpose","","1","","There are years where nothing happens, and years that can define a life. I was sixteen when I first took to the skies. Seventeen when it all came crashing down.\n\nIt began with a ship. Earlier that year, my father had salvaged a wreck from the war, a B class Deimos fighter from an abandoned staryard. It was old, outdated, and to put it bluntly, a piece of junk. The controls were shaky, the plating was rusted, and the engine coughed like it had a bad lung. \n\nBut none of that mattered to me. I was hooked from the very first grav jump. \n\nYou see, up until that point, I had often struggled to focus. Nothing I did had any long term appeal. That all changed the moment I took that Deimos junker out to the spacelanes. For the first time in my life, I could see a life for me beyond the present. This ship, for all its loose wires, dents, and pockmarks, gave me purpose. Something I could devote my life to.\n\nThree months later I was an escort for my father's freighter. \n\nTen months later, we were attacked by the Crimson Fleet.\n\nMost days, I think about my father -- the kind, gentle man who raised me. I think about how much poorer this galaxy is without his laughter soaring through its membrane. And other times, my thoughts turn to his son, the boy with the star-bright eyes, and the future he lost. \n\nWhen I am confronted by this boy. my resolve begins to wane. I want him to forgive me for the man I've become, one consumed by hate and vengeance. I stand wordless as he tugs at the corners of my jacket, tears flowing down his cheeks, begging me to let my anger go. And in that moment, every part of me wants to embrace him, and tell him exactly what he needs to hear. I want to tell him I will drop this accursed chase, and give his future the chance it deserves.\n\nBut instead, I turn away. I leave him crying, alone in the void of space. But what he does not realize, is that I am doing this for him. I fight the Crimson Fleet for all the fathers and futures lost to a world that never should have been. And when I think of them, my resolve returns, and I have purpose once more."

Then, to contrast, I like to imagine what the Fleet are talking about, there on the Key. \n\nIn war, sometimes we are asked to suspend our humanity in order to serve it. But our fight requires no such compromise. The Crimson Fleet stand in defiance to what is right and humane. If you don't believe me, just listen to what they say."
